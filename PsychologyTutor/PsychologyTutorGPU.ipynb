Negative symptoms associated with schizophrenia include speech poverty and avolition.\n","Speech poverty is a reduction in the quality and amount of speech.\n","For example, a schizophrenic person may give one-word answers to questions without elaborating any further detail.\n","Avolition is a lack of desire and motivation for anything.\n","For example, a schizophrenic person may sit around without engaging in everyday tasks such as work, socialising, or maintaining personal hygiene.\n","Biological explanations of schizophrenia look at biological factors linked to schizophrenia. These include genetics, neural (brain) abnormalities, and abnormalities in dopamine.\n","The genetic explanation of schizophrenia looks at hereditary factors – i.e. genes – that contribute to the development of schizophrenia.\n","Gottesman found that the closer the genetic relationship to the person with schizophrenia, the greater the risk of developing schizophrenia. For example, the concordance rate for schizophrenia among identical twins is 48%, whereas for non-identical twins it is 17%. This supports the idea that genetics play a role in developing schizophrenia.\n","The neural explanation of schizophrenia looks at correlations among the brain structures of people with schizophrenia.\n","There are several ways to examine the brain, such as post-mortem and fMRI scanning. By using these methods, researchers can compare the brains of schizophrenic people with non-schizophrenic people to identify differences in brain structures that may cause schizophrenia.\n","Several psychologists have proposed that family dysfunction (e.g. high levels of conflict or difficulties communicating) can influence the development of schizophrenia.\n","The diathesis-stress model of schizophrenia explains the disorder as a combination of genetic and environmental factors. According to this model, biology determines a person’s vulnerability to schizophrenia (biological diathesis), but schizophrenia is only triggered in response to environmental stressors (stress).\n","So, a person with a high genetic predisposition towards schizophrenia may never develop the disorder (e.g. if they live in a supportive low-stress environment) but a person with a lower genetic disposition may develop schizophrenia if exposed to enough environmental stress (e.g. dysfunctional family upbringing, drug abuse, etc.). In other words, genetic disposition is necessary to developing schizophrenia, but not sufficient by itself.\n"]},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["Fetching 1 files:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]"],"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"cd78db30e6ba4dd08ddda3ff87156315"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["Fetching 1 files:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]"],"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"83bc1391267c421da41cf28bbd1d21e2"}},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# generate the response:\n","llm(prompt)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":191},"id":"K1Piy1bK8vJi","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1741962563252,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":84448,"user":{"displayName":"Annie Bond","userId":"07581104602593571092"}},"outputId":"9af15805-2266-43cd-cb45-a217757ec619"},"execution_count":5,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["<ipython-input-5-88ec647f65ee>:2: LangChainDeprecationWarning: The method `BaseLLM.__call__` was deprecated in langchain-core 0.1.7 and will be removed in 1.0.
