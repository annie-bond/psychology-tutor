Note: AS level topics are in bold, whereas A level topics are not. The entire issues and options in psychology module is for A level only, not AS.

 The syllabus also mentions explanations of resistance to social influence, minority influence, and social change.
Conformity, also known as majority influence, is when a person changes their beliefs and behaviour to fit – or conform – to those of a group.



Look at the line in the box on the left. Which of the lines in the box on the right – A, B, or C – is closest in length to it?"
"1","This was the question put to participants in Asch (1955). The aim of these experiments was to find out the extent to which people would conform to an obviously wrong majority consensus."
"2","Participants’ conformity declined from 32% to 5.5% when one ‘partner’ confederate was instructed to give the correct answer and go against the incorrect answer of the majority.
Asch’s findings are consistent with other research which finds conformity rates decline when the majority answer is not unanimous. In other words, if the majority all agree, the participant is more likely to conform to the group than if there is some disagreement."
"3","Increasing the size of the group tended to increase conformity – up to a point. In trials with just one confederate and one participant, conformity rates were low. Increasing the number of confederates to 2 also increased conformity to 12.8% and increasing the number of confederates to 3 increased conformity even further to 32% (the same as the original study). However, adding extra confederates (4, 8, or 16) beyond this did not increase conformity.
Asch’s findings on conformity and majority size have been replicated in other studies, but other studies suggest conformity continues to increase with majority size beyond this."
"4","Increasing the difficulty of the task was also found to increase conformity. Asch adjusted the lengths of the lines in the study above to make it either more easy or more difficult to see which line was closest in length to the original line. If the difference between the incorrect answer and the correct answer was very small (and thus harder to notice), participants were more likely to conform to the incorrect answers of the majority.
Deutsch and Gerard (1955) explain why people conform by identifying 2 motivating forces: Informational social influence and normative social influence."
"5","People like to feel that their opinions and beliefs are correct – this is informational social influence. This desire to be correct motivates individuals to act on information provided by members of the group because they believe that information to be true or the correct way to do things.
An example of informational social influence is conforming to others’ behaviour at a formal restaurant. You don’t know which cutlery is the correct set to use, so you just copy someone else who seems to know what they’re doing."
"6","People want to be accepted by others and not be rejected – this is normative social influence. This desire to fit in motivates individuals to conform to the beliefs and opinions of a group so as not to stand out. The motivation of normative social influence is not a desire to be correct (like ISI), but is instead a desire to be liked and accepted.
An example of being motivated by normative social influence would be being peer pressured into agreeing with the group’s opinions on politics."
"7","Different social situations have different expectations for behaviour – different social norms. These norms give rise to social roles that people play according to the social situation. We play these different roles – i.e. we conform to social roles – so as to behave correctly and appropriately in society.
For example, in the role of employee, you are expected to show up on time and do your work. In the role of customer in a shop, you are expected to pay for the items you buy.
The aim of the Stanford prison study (Zimbardo et al (1973)) was to find out how much people conform to the social roles of prisoner and guard in a prison situation.
The results of the prison experiment suggest that people conform to social roles to a significant extent."
"8","In interviews with participants afterwards, both the prisoners and the guards expressed shock at how out-of-character their behaviour had become. Remember, the participants were selected for their mental stability, yet they behaved in ways that they would ordinarily consider to be wrong (particularly the guards). This supports a situational hypothesis of behaviour over a dispositional one: these people did not necessarily have a sadistic disposition, but were instead conforming to the social roles of the situation."
"9","However, it should be noted that not all participants conformed to their roles to the same extent. Some guards did not sadistically exert control and some prisoners did not break down and become totally submissive. This suggests that while situational factors are important, individual dispositions play an important role in behaviour too. Further, some studies designed to replicate Zimbardo’s have challenged his emphasis on social roles.
Obedience is when a person complies with – obeys – the orders of an authority figure.
The aim of Milgram’s (1963) obedience study was to investigate the extent to which people obey the orders of an authority figure."
"10","Milgram’s study was in part motivated by a desire to understand why Nazi soldiers in World War 2 acted how they did. For example, shortly before Milgram’s study, Adolf Eichmann – a senior Nazi officer responsible for deporting Jews to ghettos and concentration camps – defended his actions at trial by repeatedly saying “I was only following orders”. 
Milgram wanted to know if the German people had a uniquely obedient disposition that explained their behaviour. The study suggests not: American people will also obey the demands of an authority figure even if it means going against their moral compass."
"11","In subsequent studies, Milgram found that obedience declined if the participant was physically closer to the learner. For example, when the participant and the learner were in the same room, obedience fell to 40% from 65%. In one experiment, the participant teacher had to actually hold the learner’s arm onto a shock plate, which resulted in just 30% of participants completing the experiment (again vs. 65% in the original experiment).
The proximity of the authority figure also affects obedience. In experiments where the experimenter gave instructions to the participant via telephone, obedience fell to 21% compared to the original 65%."
"12","Milgram also carried out the study in different settings and found that obedience increases in institutional and official-seeming environments. For example, Milgram’s original experiment (65% obedience) was conducted at the prestigious Yale University. But when Milgram replicated the experiment in an office in a bad part of town, obedience dropped to 47.5%.
In Milgram’s original experiment, the experimenter wore a lab coat and instructed the teacher to increase the voltage. However, in another variation of the experiment, the experimenter was replaced mid-way through by someone wearing ordinary clothes, who told the participant to increase the voltage with each wrong answer. In this variation, obedience was 20% rather than 65%."
"13","The influence of uniform is further supported by Bickman (1974). Bickman found that 38% of participants obeyed the orders of someone wearing a security guard’s uniform compared to 19% when wearing ordinary clothes and 14% when wearing a milkman’s uniform.
According to Milgram’s theory, we are taught from a young age that obedience is necessary for an orderly society. But this requires individuals to give up some amount of free will. In situations where an individual obeys an authority figure, they (mentally) hand over responsibility for their actions to the person giving the orders. In the agentic state, a person will obey instructions that go against their moral compass because they do not consider themselves personally responsible for them."
"14","Another reason for obedience is that individuals may accept an authority figure has a legitimate right to be giving orders. This ties in with the agentic state: we are taught that obedience to authority figures (e.g. parents, teachers, police) is necessary for an orderly society and thus are more likely to do as they say.
Some of the variables in Milgram’s experiments clearly added to the perceived legitimacy of the experimenter’s authority. Participants were more likely to obey the experimenter if he was wearing a lab coat, and the prestigious location of Yale University likely increased the perceived legitimacy of the experimenter in the participant’s eyes. If a person accepts an authority figure as legitimate, that person will feel they have a duty to do as the authority figure says."
"15","A further explanation of obedience is that some people have an inherent disposition towards obedience. This would be an internal explanation of obedience because it explains obedience as part of someone’s personality rather than an external one that explains obedience as a result of the environment they are in.
Milgram wanted to know if the German people were uniquely disposed towards obedience and concluded not. However, within populations (German, American, or other), there may be individuals whose personality is more disposed to obedience and authoritarianism. Psychologist Erich Fromm proposed the authoritarian personality: people whose disposition makes them submissive to authority and dominating of people with lower status within the hierarchy and members of an out-group."
"16","Adorno et al (1950) created the F-scale personality test to measure the authoritarian personality in people. In later research, Milgram found that people who were highly obedient in his experiments scored higher on the F-scale than those who disobeyed. This suggests that the authoritarian personality type can (at least partly) explain obedience."
"17","Social influence has both positive and negative effects. It would be a chaotic society if nobody ever conformed to social roles (e.g. children just ignored parents, students ignored teachers, etc.) and things like teamwork would be practically impossible. But sometimes social influence can have negative effects, like being peer-pressured into dangerous behaviour or obeying an authority figure who is asking you to do something immoral (e.g. Milgram’s experiments).
So, sometimes individuals may choose to assert their own free choice and resist social influence. To resist conformity is non-conformism, and to resist obedience is disobedience.
Example question: Discuss what psychological research has told us about why people resist social influence. [16 marks]"
"18","Conformity: As mentioned above, Solomon Asch observed that participant conformity declined from 32% to 5.5% when one of the confederates went against the group and said the correct answer. Having someone else break the unanimity of the group provided social support for the participant to give the answer he really thought.
Obedience: In another variation of Milgram’s experiments, participants took part in the experiment with two other (confederate) teachers. When the other teachers refused to administer any more electric shocks and left the study, participant obedience dropped from 65% to 10%.
Conformity: A meta-analysis by Avtgis (1998) found that people with an internal locus of control are less likely to conform to group influence than people with an external locus of control."
"19","Obedience: Research linking obedience and locus of control is more mixed, but leans in the direction of also suggesting that those with an internal locus of control are less likely to obey an authority figure than those with an external locus of control. This may be because people with an internal locus of control feel they have control over their actions and thus are able to resist the influence of an authority figure.
The social norms of society (i.e. the expected rules for behaviour) are largely determined by majority influence. Social change is the process by which these norms change over time."
"20","Minority influence is an important factor for social change. Although majority influence (conformity) determines current social norms, minority influence can convert individuals to reject these social norms and adopt the beliefs and behaviours of a minority. Eventually, if enough people are converted to the minority’s beliefs, they become the new majority and establish new social norms.
An example of minority influence would be the spread of Christianity: the minority influence of this initially small movement converted many European countries to become majority Christian. Another example of minority influence would be the suffragettes converting the majority to accept women’s rights to vote."
"21","Social cryptoamnesia is the process whereby the minority influences a few members of the majority at first, but as these numbers grow it causes a snowball effect where more and more members of the majority get converted at a growing pace.
The following 3 variables increase the effectiveness of minority influence: Consistency, commitment, and flexibility.
Moscovici and Naffrechoux (1969) conducted experiments on minority influence. Participants were divided into groups of 6 (4 real participants and 2 confederates) and told they were taking part in a study of visual perception. The participants were shown 36 shades of blue and asked to say out loud what the colour was.
This suggests minority influence is more effective when the minority are consistent in their beliefs and behaviours."
"22","Moscovici also argues that minority influence is most effective when the minority remain committed to their beliefs over time (especially in the face of adversity).
Although consistency is important, minority influence is less effective if the minority is completely inflexible and unwilling to compromise with the majority."
"23","For example, Nemeth (1986) divided participants into groups of 4 (with 1 confederate) to negotiate how much insurance money to pay someone. She found that confederates who demonstrated flexibility were more effective at persuading the majority to accept a low amount than confederates who inflexibly stuck to a very low amount. Additional cognitive models break down the components of the MSM into further detail. For example, the working memory model (WMM) provides extra detail about how short-term memory works. The syllabus also requires you to know about the different types of long-term memory.
As well as these models of memory, the syllabus also mentions explanations of forgetting, and eyewitness testimony."
"24","Atkinson and Shiffrin (1968) devised the multi-store model (MSM) of memory. It is a cognitive approach that explains memory as information passing through a series of 3 storage systems: the sensory register, then short-term memory, and then long-term memory."
"25","The first system of the MSM is the sensory register. It basically contains the immediate data that comes from the senses.
If the individual pays attention to the information coming in via the sensory register, that information is passed on to the next storage system of the MSM – short-term memory – where it may be retained for longer.
The second system of the MSM is short-term memory (also called working memory within the WMM). It basically contains all the information that an individual is currently thinking about.
Extended rehearsal can transfer information from short-term memory to the next storage system of the MSM: long-term memory."
"26","Long-term memory lasts anywhere from more than 30 seconds to an entire lifetime. There are several different types of long-term memory (see below), but all long-term memories will have originally passed through both the sensory register and short-term memory.
Once a long-term memory is stored, it can be retrieved and temporarily transferred to short term memory and manipulated (this retrieval process may also improve the duration of the memory). An example of retrieval would be remembering a pleasant experience from your childhood and thinking about how you felt that day."
"27","The working memory model (WMM) was developed by Baddeley and Hitch (1974) and builds on the multi-store model – in particular, the MSM’s model of short-term memory. Rather than replacing the MSM, the WMM is better understood as a more detailed description of the MSM’s short-term memory component.
Whereas the MSM describes short-term memory as a single store, the WMM divides short-term memory into 4 separate components: the central executive, phonological loop, visuo-spatial sketchpad, and the episodic buffer. These components serve different functions and hold different types of information, which are actively worked upon as the individual thinks."
"28","Ryan was able to hold a conversation with a friend whilst driving his car. However, when reading a newspaper later that day, Ryan had to stop what he was doing in order to have a conversation with his friend. 
With reference to the working memory model, explain Ryan’s different experiences. [4 marks]
The central executive is the component that filters and co-ordinates the various components of working memory. It process sensory information coded in all forms (auditory, visual, etc.) and directs this information to three slave systems: the phonological loop, the visuo-spatial sketchpad, and the episodic buffer. The central executive also receives information from these slave systems once it has been processed by them."
"29","The central executive has a fairly limited capacity. For example, Baddeley (1996) observed that participants struggled to perform two tasks (e.g. generating lists of random numbers and switching between pressing letters and numbers on a keyboard) simultaneously, and suggested this was because both tasks were competing for central executive resources."
"30","So, part of the role of the central executive is to co-ordinate its limited capacity. For example, the central executive may direct information required for driving to the visuo-spatial sketchpad, and information required for talking would be directed to the phonological loop – allowing a person to drive and talk simultaneously. The central executive is also responsible for switching attention to specific information sources that require attention.
Research suggests the capacity of the phonological loop is limited to how long words are rather than how many words there are. For example, one long word (e.g. floccinaucinihilipification) is more difficult to store in the phonological loop than three short words (e.g. cat, boat, and happy)."
"31","The visuo-spatial sketchpad is the mind’s inner eye – it stores visual and spatial information. Information within the visuo-spatial sketchpad is coded as mental pictures.
The episodic buffer is a temporary store for information coded in all forms (auditory, visual, etc.).
The original WMM did not include the episodic buffer. But because the central executive has no storage capacity, and the phonological loop and visuo-spatial sketchpad are only able to store and process specific types of information, the introduction of the episodic buffer in 2000 explains how people can combine and store general information from the various components of short- and long-term memory."
"32","For example, the working memory of a story will likely contain visual, semantic, and chronological information (i.e. the order of events). These different types of information would be combined in the episodic buffer to form a coherent story in short-term memory.
The multi-store model of long-term memory (LTM) explains it as one single store. However, this is overly simplistic, as research suggests there are many different types of long-term memory."
"33","The main distinction is between explicit and implicit long-term memory. Explicit LTM is conscious and easy to put into words – for example remembering your first day at school (episodic), or a fact such as “Paris is the capital of France” (semantic). In contrast, implicit LTM is more subconscious and includes skills and abilities such as knowing how to ride a bike (procedural)."
"34","Episodic long-term memory covers the story of our lives – things like memories of specific events and the order they occurred in. For example, remembering your first day at school, or a holiday you went on a few years back, or some embarrassing memory of falling over are all examples of episodic long-term memory. It includes context (e.g. time and place), details of what happened, and the emotions felt.
Strong emotions (positive or negative) cause episodic memories to be coded more strongly. Similarly, if episodic memories are highly processed (for example by rehearsal/repetition) they will be coded more strongly."
"35","Semantic long-term memory covers meaning, understanding, and general knowledge. Examples of semantic memory would be facts like “the Battle of Hastings was in 1066” and general understanding of concepts like dogs as 4-legged mammals that run around and bark.
Procedural long-term memory covers how to do things – actions, skills, abilities, etc. For example, remembering how to juggle, ride a bicycle, or drive a car. We begin forming procedural memories from a young age – things like knowing how to walk and talk are learned and then stored as procedural memory."
"36","Although procedural memories are easy to act out, they are difficult/impossible to consciously explain in words. So, unlike semantic and episodic LTM, procedural memory is implicit. The fact that procedural memories do not require conscious thought means they can be recalled while simultaneously performing other cognitive activities – for example, trying to remember what the tallest mountain is (semantic, explicit) while walking along the road (procedural, implicit).
Forgetting is the inability to remember memories. Although there are many explanations of forgetting, the A level psychology syllabus lists two specifically: Interference and retrieval failure due to absence of cues"
"37","Proactive interference is when older information interferes with your ability to remember something newer. For example, you’re trying to remember the new login password you set but you keep thinking of your previous one.
Retroactive interference is the reverse of proactive interference: It’s when newer information gets disrupted by older information. For example, you’re trying to remember your home address from 10 years ago but you keep thinking of your home address from 2 years ago."
"38","The second explanation of forgetting is an absence of cues. This happens when information is stored in long-term memory but can’t be accessed because there is nothing to trigger the memory. Tulving and Thomson (1973) suggest that forgetting is more likely to occur when the context in which the memory is recalled is different from the context in which the memory was coded.
Context-dependent failure is when the external environment does not provide the cues necessary to recall a memory. For example, you might be perfectly able to remember your bank card pin code when you have to type it in an ATM, but struggle to remember it when walking along a beach.
State-dependent failure is when the internal environment during recall is different from the internal environment when the memory was coded."
"39","An example of a differing internal environment would be being sober vs. on drugs. For example, Darley et al (1973) observed that participants who forgot where they hid money while high on cannabis were more likely to remember where they hid that money once they got high again compared to when they were sober.
Eyewitness testimony is where a person who was present at an event recalls what happened. It’s often used as evidence in court, but eyewitness testimony can be unreliable. So, psychological research into the factors affecting eyewitness testimony and how it can be improved is important to help ensure fair and accurate trials."
"40","Several psychological studies have shown the accuracy of eyewitness testimony can be altered after the event by exposing the witness to misleading information during post-event discussion."
"41","Asking the question using a more intense the verb (e.g. ‘smashed’) rather than a less intense verb (e.g. ‘contacted’), influenced the participant to estimate a higher speed. This supports the claim that asking leading questions affects eyewitness testimony.
In another study, Loftus (1975) found that leading questions can add false information to a memory. For example, in one experiment, participants were shown a video of a car journey and then asked “how fast was the car going when it passed the white barn?” despite there being no barn at all in the video. When asked to recall the event a week later, 17% of participants falsely remembered seeing a barn."
"42","Another factor affecting eyewitness testimony is the witness’ anxiety levels. This is particularly relevant when witnesses are recalling anxiety-inducing events, such as violent crimes.
Deffenbacher (1983) suggested an ‘inverted-U’ hypothesis for the relationship between anxiety and the accuracy of eyewitness testimony. According to this hypothesis, a moderate amount of anxiety produces the most accurate and detailed eyewitness testimony. However, too much or too little anxiety reduces the accuracy of the eyewitness testimony."
"43","Research on the inverted-U hypothesis is somewhat conflicting. For example, in interviews with witnesses to bank robberies, Christianson and Hubinette (1993) found no relationship between anxiety and accuracy of testimony, weakening support for the inverted-U hypothesis."
"44","However, several studies support the inverted-U hypothesis. For example, Loftus et al (1987) found that when an incident involves a weapon, witnesses will often focus on the weapon over all other details such as the perpetrator’s face, clothes, voice, etc. This ‘weapons effect’ supports the hypothesis that very high levels of anxiety reduce the accuracy and detail of eyewitness testimony. Further, a meta-analysis by Deffenbacher et al (2004) found high levels of stress negatively affect eyewitness testimony, further supporting the inverted-U hypothesis."
"45","Psychologists have applied the kind of research above to develop methods for improving memory recall. An example of this is the cognitive interview.
The cognitive interview is a method of conducting police interviews to improve the accuracy and detail of eyewitness testimony. It draws on some of the research above, such as the need for cues to help trigger memory. The syllabus also mentions various animal studies of attachment.
A newborn baby is unable to support itself, and so must develop attachment bonds with adults who can provide it with food, shelter, and protection."
"46","Although a newborn baby cannot speak with a caregiver to develop these bonds, there are several ways infants and caregivers communicate that help develop an attachment between them. The syllabus mentions two in particular: Interactional synchrony and reciprocity.
Interactions between caregivers and infants are not simply one-way, they are reciprocal. For example, when the baby smiles, it will often make the mother smile back and vice versa. These kinds of reciprocal interactions strengthen the emotional connection between infant and caregiver."
"47","The reciprocal interactions between infant and caregiver are somewhat synchronised. For example, you might pull a funny face, the baby laughs, and then you laugh back. These kinds of interactions are rhythmic and co-ordinated, with both infant and caregiver ‘taking turns’ in a similar way to how adults take turns to speak in conversations. These synchronous interactions further strengthen the bond between infant and caregiver."
"48","In most cases, an infant’s primary attachment figure will be its mother. However, in many cases, it will be the father instead.
Traditionally, mothers and fathers play different roles. The mother is typically seen as occupying the caregiving and nurturing role to the infant, whereas the father is seen as a playmate who provides more physical and exciting play than the mother. Due to this, infants tend to prefer contact with their fathers when they are feeling happy and positive and want to play, but prefer contact with their mothers when they are upset and want comforting."
"49","Although fathers have typically been seen as occupying a less important role than the mother, societal changes (such as more mothers going out to work) mean men are often expected to play a bigger role in parenting than before. It is increasingly common for men to be the infant’s primary caregiver instead of just a playmate.
A lot of early psychological research into attachment was conducted on animals. This is because such research is generally considered more ethical than if conducted on humans, yet there are many similarities between humans and animals that can inform knowledge of human psychology."
"50","Imprinting is a form of attachment where an animal (particularly birds) develops an attachment to the first large moving object it sees. In 1935, Konrad Lorenz conducted a study with the aim of investigating the mechanisms and effects of imprinting.
This experiment demonstrates imprinting. The newly hatched goslings developed an attachment to the first moving object they encountered, regardless of whether it was their biological mother or not. Lorenz noted that imprinting occurred within 4-25 hours after birth.
The aim of Harry Harlow’s 1959 studies was to test whether attachment is based solely on food (as learning theory might suggest) or whether there is more to attachment than this."
"51","These experiments suggest monkeys are born with an innate need for comforting via physical contact and that this physical contact is more important for attachment than food is (as learning theory might suggest). A lack of physical contact is likely to cause stress in infant monkeys."
"52","The syllabus mentions two explanations of why humans form attachments: Learning theory (behaviour learned through conditioning) and Bowlby’s monotropic theory (the result of an innate instinct to form an attachment).
Learning theory explains attachment as behaviours learned through conditioning.

Learning theories of attachment may also reference operant conditioning (again, see the approaches page for more details). For example, reducing the unpleasant feeling of hunger may negatively reinforce attachment towards the caregiver."
"53","Bowlby rejects learning theory as an explanation of attachment. Influenced by Lorenz and Harlow’s animal studies, Bowlby instead argued that humans evolved an innate capacity to form an attachment to one (hence monotropic) attachment figure from birth – usually the mother. Although infants may develop other attachments beyond this, these attachments are secondary and much less important.
Bowlby’s explanation of monotropic theory is evolutionary: In a dangerous environment, infants would die if left to fend for themselves, so nature selects for those babies who naturally behave in ways that form bonds with caregivers who will protect them. These natural behaviours are not learned, as learning theory suggests, but are instead pre-programmed from birth (innate)."
"54","According to Bowlby’s theory, there is a critical period within which an infant can develop attachments. After this period, the infant will have difficulty forming attachments at all.
For most infants, this critical period is 12 months after birth. Although some infants may develop attachments after this time, Bowlby believed all infants must develop attachments within 3 years. According to Bowlby’s maternal deprivation hypothesis, forming an attachment to the mother in this critical period is essential for healthy psychological development."
"55","Bowlby’s theory says that an infant’s monotropic (primary) attachment forms a template for all relationships that follow. This template is known as the internal working model and is a cognitive framework through which the individual understands themself and their expectations for relationships to other people. The internal working model also creates some consistency between the emotional experiences of early life and the emotional experiences of later relationships."
"56","The syllabus lists 3 types of infant attachment styles: secure, insecure-avoidant, and insecure-resistant. These differing attachment styles can be observed in the strange situation procedure, which produces varying outcomes when conducted in different cultures.
Ainsworth et al (1978) developed a method for testing infant attachment known as the strange situation."
"57","One of Ainsworth’s strange situation studies involved 106 infants 9-18 months old and their mothers. The aim of this study was to test the infants’ stranger anxiety, separation anxiety, and reunion behaviour. Ainsworth also wanted to observe infants’ exploration behaviour (which is seen as important for cognitive development).
Ainsworth identified 3 types of attachment from observation of the infants’ behaviour during the strange situation procedure: secure attachment, insecure-avoidant, and insecure-resistant."
"58","Many studies across many different cultures have used the strange situation procedure to measure attachment styles. Van Ijzendoorn and Kroonenberg (1988) conducted a meta-analysis (a study of studies) with the aim of determining whether attachment styles are universal across cultures or whether cultural conditions affect attachment styles.
The procedure for the meta-analysis involved collecting data from 32 studies across 8 countries. Together, these studies observed a total of 1990 mother-child pairs in the strange situation procedure."
"59","These results suggest that culture does play a part in attachment styles. For example, studies in Western cultures (e.g. Germany, Britain, USA) tended to observe significantly higher insecure-avoidant attachment styles. In contrast, Japan, China, and Israel had significantly higher insecure-resistant attachment styles.
However, in many cases, intra-cultural differences (differences between studies conducted within the same country) were often greater than inter-cultural differences (differences between studies conducted in two different countries). For example, while one USA study observed 94% of infants had insecure-avoidant attachments, a different USA study observed that just 47% of infants had insecure-avoidant attachments."
"60","Attachments in infancy appear to be highly important for psychological development. The syllabus looks at the influence of infant attachment on adult psychology, as well as the effects of breaking early attachments as observed in the Romanian orphan studies and according to Bowlby’s maternal deprivation hypothesis.
Bowlby argued that attachments between infants and their mothers – particularly during the critical period before age 3 – are essential to healthy psychological development."
"61","More importantly, Bowlby argued that if infants are separated from their mothers for a long time (deprivation) during the critical period (e.g. when the mother dies) then it will permanently damage the infant’s psychological development. For example, he believed that maternal deprivation can lead to aggression, social maladjustment, and depression.
Privation is when an infant never forms an attachment. It may occur when an infant is raised away from their parents in an institution such as an orphanage or a children’s home. The psychological and behavioural effects of being raised in such institutions are known as institutionalisation."
"62","Rutter et al (1998) studied the effects of privation and institutionalisation in their Romanian orphan studies. Conditions in Romania in the early 1990s were difficult, and the children placed in orphanages suffered from minimal contact with adults and poor nutrition. A key aim of Rutter’s study was to see whether the effects of such extreme privation in early life could be overcome with love and care.
These findings suggest institutionalisation can be largely reversed if the infant is shown love and care. However, the longer the infant goes without forming an attachment, the more likely they are to suffer permanent developmental issues."
"63","Bowlby’s internal working model forms the basis of the continuity hypothesis: the theory that attachments in early life form the basis for attachments later on, i.e. that there is continuity between early and later attachments.
Example question: Discuss the influence of early attachment on relationships as an adult. [8 marks]
Research suggests early infant attachments affect friendships in childhood."
"64","Research suggests early infant attachments affect friendships in childhood.
For example, Youngblade and Belsky (1992) conducted a longitudinal study of 73 children. They found that children who had demonstrated secure attachment styles at 1 year old (as measured using the strange situation procedure) were more likely to have close friendships and get along well with other children by ages 3-5. The continuity between infant attachment and child friendships is also supported by Laible et al (2000), who found that adolescents who scored highly for parent attachment were also more likely to score highly for peer attachment too. 
The continuity with infant attachments extends into adulthood too. Both romantic attachments and parenting styles are correlated with infant attachment styles."
"65","Hazan and Shaver (1987) conducted a study to test for continuity between infant attachment styles and romantic attachments as adults. Participants completed questionnaires that asked them to say which of 3 statements best applied to their feelings on romantic relationships – and each of these 3 statements would correspond to one of Ainsworth’s attachment styles (secure, insecure-avoidant, and insecure-resistant). Participants were also asked to complete a checklist on childhood relationships with parents, with answers again corresponding to Ainsworth’s attachment styles."
"66","The researchers found correlations between infant attachment styles and views on romantic relationships. For example, participants who were identified as securely attached infants from the childhood checklist tended to have longer lasting relationships and lower divorce rates as adults compared to those with insecure infant attachment styles. Both insecure attachment styles were more vulnerable to loneliness, with insecure-resistant types being most likely to be lonely. Adults who had insecure-avoidant attachment styles as infants tended to believe that love is rare and felt that they did not need romantic partners to be happy."
"67","Several studies, for example Bailey et al (2007), have found that attachment styles in infancy are correlated with parenting styles in adulthood. Psychopathology is the study of mental disorders and conditions that are considered psychologically abnormal. Defining ‘abnormal’ is a topic in itself, with the syllabus mentioning 4 definitions of abnormality: deviation from social norms, failure to function adequately, statistical infrequency, and deviation from ideal mental health.
Note that these are not the only valid psychological approaches to these disorders. For example, phobias can be treated biologically (e.g. with drugs) and OCD can be treated cognitively (e.g. cognitive behavioural therapy). These alternative approaches can be used to evaluate the approach listed in the syllabus."
"68","Each of these definitions has various strengths and weaknesses, which are covered in the AO3 evaluation points below.
We can define abnormality as behaviour that deviates from these social norms. For example, going up and touching random strangers or walking around naked is abnormal.
The degree to which a behaviour is abnormal depends on how extreme the deviation is and how important the norm is. For example, not saying “thank you” might be somewhat abnormal – but it’s not dangerous, just rude. However, going up to and touching random strangers is a more extreme deviation of a more important rule and so may justify intervention from other people to stop this behaviour."
"69","Another definition of abnormality is failure to function adequately. This means a person is unable to navigate everyday life or behave in the necessary ways to live a ‘normal’ life. For example, failure to function adequately would prevent a person from having successful interpersonal interactions or get and keep a job.
The Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale provides a way to quantify (from 0 to 100) the extent to which a mental disorder affects an individual’s ability to function adequately. A person who scores highly (e.g. 80+) will have few if any symptoms that prevent their ability to function, whereas a person with a very low score (<20) will struggle in society and may even be a danger to themself or others."
"70","The statistical infrequency definition of abnormality is a mathematical one. It defines abnormality as statistically rare characteristics and behaviours. The further a characteristic or behaviour is from the mathematical average, the more rare or statistically infrequent it is."
"71","The average here is indicated by 0 on the X-axis. The other figures indicate standard deviations (σ) from this average. The more a figure deviates from the average, the rarer it is.
For example, 68.2% of people – the majority – will be within 1 standard deviation of this average (34.1% above and 34.1% below). It is statistically more rare to be above or below 1 standard deviation from the average, and much rarer still to be more than 2 standard deviations from the average."
"72","Many psychological traits and behaviours can be quantified and plotted on a graph like the one above. For example, intelligence can be quantified by IQ tests. The average IQ is 100, and most people will have an IQ within 1 standard deviation of this (i.e. between 85 and 115). An IQ above 130 or below 70 is statistically infrequent – it occurs in only around 2% of people – and so, according to this definition, would be considered psychologically abnormal.
Another definition of abnormality is deviation from ideal mental health."
"73","Another definition of abnormality is deviation from ideal mental health.
Someone with ideal mental health would tick all 6 of these boxes. However, if a person fails to tick most of these boxes, or deviates significantly from one of them (e.g. they constantly hallucinate pink elephants and thus do not have an accurate perception of reality), they would be classified as abnormal according to the deviation from ideal mental health definition.
Emotional characteristics: It is natural to feel some fear in response to potential danger. But people with phobias experience extreme fear that is uncontrollable and disproportionate to the situation."
"74","Behavioural characteristics: Screaming, crying, freezing, or running away from the feared stimuli. A phobic person will typically try to avoid the feared stimuli – for example, a person with aerophobia might stay away from airports.
Cognitive characteristics: Most people with phobias recognise that their fear is irrational and disproportionate. However, this recognition does little to reduce the fear the phobic person feels.
There are many competing and complementary approaches to psychology, including behaviourism, the cognitive approach, and the biological approach. The syllabus focuses on the behaviourist approach to phobias, but other approaches can serve as a means to evaluate this approach."
"75","The behavioural approach (behaviourism) analyses phobias based on external observations of environmental stimuli and behavioural responses (rather than e.g. the underlying thought processes). The two-process model explains how phobias are developed and maintained through behavioural conditioning."
"76","Humans naturally fear pain, and so a fear response to pain is unconditioned. But when this natural (unconditioned) response is associated with a neutral stimulus (e.g. a dog) through experience (e.g. a dog biting them), then a person can become conditioned to associate the response (fear) with the stimulus (dogs). This is an example of classical conditioning, which is based on the work of Ivan Pavlov."
"77","An example of this humans can be found in Watson & Rayner (1920). In their experiment, an 11 month old baby – ‘Little Albert’ – was given a white rat to play with. Albert did not demonstrate a fear response towards the rat initially, but the researchers then made a loud noise which frightened Albert. This process was repeated several times, after which Albert demonstrated fear behaviour (e.g. crawling away, whimpering) when presented with the rat (and similar stimuli such as a rabbit and a fur coat) even without the loud noise."
"78","Classical conditioning is outside a person’s conscious control – the conditioned response develops automatically. In contrast, operant conditioning occurs in response to behaviour, which is under a person’s control. If a person behaves in a way that produces a pleasurable outcome, then that behaviour is positively reinforced, making the person more likely to behave that way again. Similarly, if a person behaves in a way that reduces an unpleasant feeling, then that behaviour is negatively reinforced, also making them more likely to behave that way again."
"79","Within the two-process model, this sort of operant conditioning explains how phobias are maintained. Returning to the phobia of dogs example: A person with a conditioned phobia of dogs will feel anxiety in the presence of dogs. And so, avoiding dogs (e.g. by running away from them or avoiding parks) will lessen this anxiety, which negatively reinforces these dog-avoiding behaviours. This pattern of behaviour and reward via operant conditioning reinforces and thus maintains the phobia."
"80","One behavioural treatment for phobias is systematic desensitisation. This involves gradually increasing exposure to the feared stimuli until it no longer induces anxiety. For example, someone with a fear of spiders (arachnophobia) may initially be asked to imagine spiders and guided through relaxation strategies until they can stay calm. Then, the process may be repeated with pictures of spiders, then real-life spiders in cages, and then repeated again with the subject actually holding a spider.
Systematic desensitisation is another example of classical conditioning: the subject is conditioned to associate the object with relaxation instead of anxiety."
"81","An example of successful treatment of phobia using systematic desensitisation is described in Jones (1924). A 2 year old boy – Peter – had a phobia of white rats and similar stimuli. Jones was able to remove Peter’s phobia over several sessions with him by progressively increasing his exposure to a white rabbit.
Another behavioural approach to treating phobias is flooding. Whereas systematic desensitisation increases exposure step-by-step, flooding involves exposing the subject to the most extreme scenarios straight away. For example, returning to arachnophobia, the subject would be placed in direct contact with spiders until their anxiety response subsides."
"82","The idea behind flooding is that extreme anxiety cannot be maintained indefinitely. Eventually, the fear subsides and, in theory, the phobia.
An example of successful treatment of phobia using flooding is described in Wolpe (1969). A girl with a phobia of cars was driven around in a car for four hours until she calmed down and her phobia disappeared.
Depression is a mood disorder characterised by feelings of low mood, loss of motivation, and inability to feel pleasure.
There are two kinds of depression: unipolar and bipolar. Bipolar depression (sometimes called manic depression) is characterised by the descriptions below + occasional manic symptoms whereas unipolar depression is characterised by these symptoms only with no manic episodes."
"83","Emotional characteristics: People with depression experience persistent feelings of sadness and hopelessness. This low mood may come and go in cycles lasting months or years. Depression is also typically accompanied by feelings of worthlessness and a lack of enthusiasm.
Behavioural characteristics: Low energy, reduced activity, and reduced social interaction. Depressed people may also have irregular sleep patterns (either sleeping too much or too little (insomnia)) and gain or lose weight from over- or under-eating.
Cognitive characteristics: Depressed people may have exaggerated or delusional negative thoughts about themselves and what people think of them. They may have difficulty concentrating and remembering things. A depressed person may also regularly think about death and suicide."
"84","There are many competing and complementary approaches to psychology, including behaviourism, the cognitive approach, and the biological approach. The syllabus focuses on the cognitive approach to depression, but other approaches can serve as a means to evaluate this approach.
The cognitive approach analyses depression in terms of irrational and undesirable thoughts and thought processes (rather than e.g. the behaviours that result from these thought processes). The syllabus lists two cognitive explanations of depression: Beck’s negative triad and Ellis’ ABC model.
Example question: Discuss cognitive explanations of depression. [16 marks]"
"85","Schema are patterns of thought – shortcuts/generalisations/frameworks – that are learned from experience to help make sense of the world and categorise information. Beck argued that experiences in childhood, such as criticism or failure to meet expectations, can cause depression-prone individuals to develop negative schema (i.e. a negative lens through which the individual views themself and the world). For example, experiences of failure in childhood may lead an individual to develop an ineptness schema whereby they constantly expect to fail."
"86","These negative schema are caused by and amplify cognitive biases. Biases are systematic deviations from an accurate perception of reality in favour of some less accurate interpretation. For example, a person who loses a game of chance may falsely interpret this as proof that he is simply an unlucky person.
Together, these negative schema and cognitive biases maintain a negative triad of depressive beliefs about the self, the world, and the future.
Ellis (1962) argued that depression results from irrational interpretation of negative events, rather than the negative events themselves. He explains this process using the ABC model of activating event, belief, and consequence."
"87","According to Ellis, we all have assumptions and beliefs (think schema) about ourselves and the world. With depressed people, though, these beliefs are often irrational and this leads them to interpret events (activating events) in an unrealistic way that causes a negative emotional reaction (consequence).
Again, it is not the activating event itself that causes the negative emotional consequence, but the irrational belief through which the activating event is interpreted.
The cognitive approach sees depression as caused by negative, irrational, and maladaptive thought patterns. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) seeks to treat depression by identifying these depressed thought patterns and replacing them with alternate ones."
"88","CBT therapists help patients to identify depressed thought patterns. The therapist may then encourage the patient to question these depressed thought patterns and recognise them as unhelpful and not representative of reality. The patient is then encouraged to replace these irrational and unhelpful thoughts with more accurate and helpful thoughts. Replacing the depressed thoughts with more helpful thoughts affects the patient’s mood, which in turn affects the patient’s behaviour.
There is often also a behavioural component to CBT. For example, therapy may involve scheduled activities, keeping a diary of thoughts, etc."
"89","Albert Ellis developed a form of CBT based on his ABC model, known as rational emotive behaviour therapy (REBT).
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is an anxiety disorder characterised by continuous and repeated undesirable thoughts (obsessions) and uncontrollable behaviours and rituals in response to these thoughts (compulsions).
For example, a person may have an obsessive fixation on germs, which leads them to constantly worry that everything is unclean and dirty. These thoughts may lead to compulsive hand-washing behaviour and rituals as the individual tries to alleviate these obsessive worries.
Emotional characteristics: High levels of anxiety and stress in response to obsessive thoughts and inability to control compulsive behaviours."
"90","Behavioural characteristics: Continuous repetition of rituals and behaviours in response to obsessive thoughts. Both the obsessive thoughts and the compulsive behaviours get in the way of everyday functioning, disrupting normal activities such as work and social interaction.
Cognitive characteristics: OCD sufferers will continually repeat thoughts to do with their obsession and cognitive biases mean they have difficulty focusing on anything else. Many OCD sufferers are aware their obsessive thoughts are inappropriate and exaggerated but are unable to control them."
"91","There are many competing and complementary approaches to psychology, including behaviourism, the cognitive approach, and the biological approach. The syllabus focuses on the biological approach to OCD, but other approaches can serve as a means to evaluate this approach.
Biological approaches analyse OCD in physiological terms, i.e. as a result of abnormal biological processes. The syllabus lists two different biological explanations of OCD: genetics and neural problems.
Genes are inherited biologically from parents. There is evidence that genes contribute to the development of OCD."
"92","For example, twin studies suggest a genetic component to OCD. Grootheest et al (2005) conducted a review of more than 70 years of studies on twins and OCD using various methods. One of these methods compared the rates of OCD between identical twins and between non-identical twins. The researchers found it was far more likely for both identical twins to have OCD than for both non-identical twins to have OCD. This supports a genetic role in OCD: Identical twins have identical genetics and so if there is a genetic component to OCD it would make sense that both twins would be similarly prone to developing OCD. With non-identical twins, the different genes could explain why one twin was more likely to develop OCD than the other."
"93","Other studies have used gene mapping to identify correlations between certain genes and OCD. For example, Davis et al (2013) compared the genetic profiles of 1500 OCD sufferers with 5500 non-OCD controls. The researchers’ method (genome-wide complex trait analysis) looked for traits across the entire genome (rather than looking for individual genes) and found the OCD sufferers often shared similar genetic elements that were not present in the non-OCD controls.
Another biological mechanism for OCD is neural (i.e. brain and nervous system) abnormalities. These abnormalities may be structural and/or neurochemical."
"94","Brain scans consistently show that OCD sufferers have increased activity in the orbital frontal cortex area of the brain (e.g. Saxena and Rauch (2000)). The orbital frontal cortex is sometimes called the ‘worry circuit’ and is responsible for high-level decision making and thinking (as opposed to low-level primal instincts). When you have an impulse (e.g. to wash your hands when they are dirty), the orbital frontal cortex translates that impulse into action (e.g. washing your hands), and performing that action reduces the impulse. However, with OCD sufferers, it may be that the overactivity of the orbital frontal cortex means these impulses continue even after performing the behaviour, becoming obsessions and compulsions."
"95","Other studies implicate hyperactivity of the basal ganglia in OCD (e.g. Max et al (1995)).
Another possible neural explanation of OCD is neurochemistry. For example, several studies (e.g. Hu et al (2006)) suggest that OCD sufferers have lower levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin compared to controls. Some brain scans also suggest OCD sufferers have higher dopamine levels than healthy controls.
Biological treatment of OCD aims to address the biological mechanisms that cause OCD. The most common biological treatment for OCD is drug therapy."
"96","The most common drugs prescribed for OCD are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as Prozac. SSRIs are also known as antidepressants. SSRIs work by increasing serotonin levels, which often reduces obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviours to a level that allows the patient to live a more normal life. The effectiveness of SSRIs fits with the neural explanation of OCD that OCD is caused (at least in part) by low serotonin."
"97","If OCD symptoms do not improve with SSRIs, a doctor may also prescribe antipsychotic drugs such as risperidone. One mechanism of risperidone is to reduce dopamine activity, which supports the neural explanation that high dopamine contributes to OCD. There are multiple different ways to approach the study of psychology. For example, a biological approach might explain depression as a chemical imbalance, a cognitive approach might explain it in terms of maladaptive thought processes, and learning approaches might explain it as a result of negative life experiences."
"98","Note: A level students need to understand the basic assumptions of these 5 approaches and be able to evaluate and compare them with one another. AS students only need to learn the basic assumptions of the first 3, and are not required to compare these approaches.
The topic also includes details on the origins of psychology.
Practice papers with A* answers book #2 contains five full exam papers with five approaches in psychology sections. These questions are closely based on the format of the AQA papers and are designed to be possible questions that could come up in the 2023 exam. 
Example question: Outline and evaluate social learning theory. Refer to Timmy’s behaviour in your answer. [16 marks]"
"99","Humans have studied the mind in some sense for thousands of years (e.g. philosophers, theologians, scientists). But the dedicated study of psychology – as we know it today – only started taking form in the late 19th Century with Wilhelm Wundt.
Wundt founded the first psychology laboratory – the Institute of Experimental Psychology – in 1879 and is often called the ‘father of experimental psychology’. As part of his experiments, Wundt pioneered the technique of introspection. Introspection involves looking ‘inward’ and examining one’s thoughts, emotions, and sensations. For example, an experiment might involve showing subjects a picture, and the subjects would then report back their inner experiences."
"100","For Wundt, introspection was not about reporting whatever random thing the subject felt. It was intended as a highly systematic and controlled process – a science. Wundt carefully controlled the environments and researchers were trained to adopt the right mental state and then report back the specific data Wundt wanted. Despite this rigour, Wundt often found that reports were highly subjective and varied from person to person, which meant they were unreliable.
Since Wundt, a variety of approaches to psychology have emerged – some more ‘scientific’ than others."
"101","Science is concerned with empirically observable facts that can be repeated and measured. For example, by repeatedly observing and measuring objects falling to the ground, scientists can deduce the laws that govern these observations (e.g. gravity). In theory, the science of psychology would observe human behaviour and deduce the laws that govern it in a similar way.
Learning approaches measure and explain human behaviour as a product of environment and experience. The A level psychology syllabus specifies two learning approaches: behaviourism and social learning theory.
The behaviourist approach to psychology explains behaviour as a result of learning from experience, such as via classical and operant conditioning."
"102","Classical conditioning is a key principle of behaviourism. It explains how behaviours are learned from experience via (subconscious) association.
The earliest and most famous documentation of classical conditioning is found in Pavlov (1927). Pavlov demonstrated how dogs could be conditioned to salivate (a natural response to food) in response to a bell ringing (a neutral stimulus) by ringing the bell at the same time as presenting the dog with food. The repeated occurrence of the bell ringing at the same time as the food meant the dogs learned to associate the bell with food. Eventually, this association produced a conditioned response in the dogs, who would salivate at the sound of the bell even when there was no food."
"103","As mentioned, a basic assumption of behaviourism is the validity of animal studies in explaining human behaviour. And, in the case of classical conditioning, there are plenty of human examples like the one above. For example, hearing a phone notification go off (even if it’s someone else’s with the same tone) may cause you to instinctively reach into your pocket for your phone.
Other examples of classical conditioning in humans can be seen in the behaviourist explanation of phobias.
Operant conditioning is another principle of behaviourism. It explains how behaviours are learned from and reinforced in response to consequences."
"104","In one variation of the experiment, pressing the response lever caused food to come out of the food dispenser. The rat quickly learned this consequence and so would repeat the behaviour to get more food. This is an example of positive reinforcement.
Another variation of the experiment demonstrated learning through negative reinforcement. In this setup, an electrified grid would cause pain to the rat but pressing the response lever turned the electrified grid off. Similar to the other experiment, the rats quickly learned to go straight to the response lever when put in the box.
These experiments demonstrate how learning through positive and negative reinforcement increases the chances of a behaviour being repeated."
"105","Like behaviourism, the social learning approach to psychology also explains behaviour as a result of learning from experience, but adds the extra element of learning by observing others’ behaviour.
Bandura and Huston (1961) observed that children imitate the behaviours of role models they identify with. The aim of another study, Bandura et al (1961), was to see if this behavioural imitation continued even when the role model was no longer present.
People imitate (copy) the behaviours of role models they identify with (i.e. people they are like or want to be like). For example, the fact that children were more likely to imitate/model the behaviour of the role model if they were of the same gender could be because they were more likely to identify with the role model."
"106","Another key concept is vicarious reinforcement, which is where a person is more likely to imitate a behaviour if they observe the model being rewarded for it. Vicarious reinforcement is demonstrated in Bandura and Walters (1963), which was another variation of the Bobo the doll where the model was either praised or punished for acting aggressively towards the doll. Children who saw the model praised for their aggression toward the doll were more likely to imitate this aggressive behaviour."
"107","As mentioned above, social learning theory is not entirely behaviourist. We don’t just automatically imitate every behaviour we observe. Instead, there are various cognitive processes in between that determine whether someone imitates a behaviour or not.
The cognitive approach to psychology explains behaviour as a result of cognitive processes such as thoughts, beliefs, and perceptions.
Schema are a key part of the cognitive approach. They are cognitive frameworks, mental models, patterns of thought and behaviour. They are mental short-cuts, ways of organising information and understanding the world.
Basically, schema covers a lot of things. Our schemas inform our perception of the world – they are the cognitive lens through which we make sense of reality."
"108","Schema are formed from experience. We form schema blueprints and use them to interpret the past, categorise information in the present, and form expectations/predictions for the future. Because people have different experiences, they have different schema.
Schema change over time. For example, a young child might form the simple schema that dog = 4 legged furry animal. But this schema would include cats, too. So, over time, the child refines its schemas to become more detailed.
However, once a schema is formed, it can be difficult to change: People tend to be biased towards information that fits pre-existing schema, and often ignore or re-interpret contradictory information in order to fit their existing schema."
"109","Advocates of the cognitive approach often think of mental processes as analogous to computer processes. With a computer, data goes in, it gets processed, then you get an output."
"110","Obviously this is a very simple example, but all computer programs work in this way. When you’re playing a game, for example, controller inputs are processed, which changes the output displayed on screen. When you input a URL in your browser, it gets processed (through multiple computers) until the browser displays the output of the website you entered."
"111","So, the cognitive approach explains behaviour as a series of processing steps analogous to the processing steps of a computer. These processing steps can be broken down into theoretical models, which can be tested against observation to see if they are accurate.
The cognitive approach uses theoretical models to explain the cognitions (mental processes) behind behaviour.
An example of such a theoretical model is the multi-store model of memory from elsewhere in the course: It explains how information flows through various components for processing. For example, paying attention to sensory information causes it to be transferred (processed) to short-term memory."
"112","Cognitive neuroscience is the study of the relationship between brain activity and mental processes. It looks at the biological workings underlying cognition and so can be thought of as a mixture between the cognitive and biological approaches."
"113","As technology has advanced (most notably brain-scanning techniques such as fMRI and PET), scientists have been able to identify correlations between certain types of brain activity and certain types of mental processes. For example, Braver et al (1997) observed that greater working memory load (a cognitive concept) is correlated with greater prefrontal cortex activity (a biological concept). This suggests the underlying biological basis for working memory is situated in that area of the brain. As cognitive neuroscience advances, more cognitive processes might be analysable in biological terms.
The biological approach to psychology explains behaviour as a result of biological factors such as genetics, biological structures, and neurochemistry."
"114","Just as physical characteristics – such as eye colour and hair colour – are determined by genetics inherited from parents, so too are certain behavioural tendencies.
An example of this is the genetic explanation of OCD from elsewhere in the course. But other psychological traits – e.g. intelligence, or aggression – also have a genetic component that can be passed on from parents to children.
Twin studies can confirm the genetic influence of psychological traits.
The concordance rate is the rate at which twins share the same trait. If the concordance rate for a psychological disorder is higher among identical twins (monozygotic twins) than non-identical twins (dizygotic twins), this suggests a genetic component to the disorder."
"115","The reason for this is that the identical twins have 100% identical genetics whereas non-identical twins only share 50% of their genes. So, if a disorder is entirely determined by genetics, then identical twins would both develop the disorder because they share identical genes. However, because non-identical twins only share 50% of their genes, there is a chance that only one of them will inherit the genetics for the disorder but not the other.
In reality, most psychological disorders are a combination of genetic and environmental factors. However, the examples above illustrate how there is a strong genetic component to many psychological disorders. If one identical twin has OCD, for example, there is a 68% chance the other twin will too."
"116","If psychological behaviours and psychological disorders have a genetic component (as the biological approach believes), then it follows that these psychological traits would be subject to evolution in the same way that physical traits are.
For example, intelligence: If there was a gene that made a human better at hunting food, then the human with that gene would be less likely to starve to death and so more likely to pass on their genes to the next generation."
"117","Another example of evolved psychological traits could be Bowlby’s monotropic theory of attachment. Bowlby argued that babies evolved to develop an attachment to one person – usually its mother. This behaviour makes the baby more likely to survive and pass on its genes because a baby that does not develop an attachment will be left to fend for itself in a dangerous environment and probably die before it gets the chance to procreate.
Note: This topic is A level only, you don’t need to learn about the psychodynamic approach if you are taking the AS exam only.
The psychodynamic approach to psychology explains behaviour as a result of unconscious processes."
"118","The psychodynamic approach to psychology explains behaviour as a result of unconscious processes.
Freud’s psychoanalytic theory is the most influential example of a psychodynamic approach to psychology. It emphasises the role of the unconscious mind in determining behaviour.
A lot of significant psychological activity happens below the level of what is consciously available. However, these unconscious thoughts often bubble to the surface in things like dreams and ‘Freudian’ slips of the tongue (e.g. accidentally calling your girlfriend ‘Mum’). Psychoanalysts use psychoanalysis to identify and interpret these unconscious thoughts and their meanings, which then serve as a basis for treating psychological disorders."
"119","According to this theory, behaviour is determined by the interaction of these three parts. The ego sits in the middle and tries to balance the competing demands of the id (i.e. base biological drives) and superego (i.e. moral beliefs about right and wrong). Improper balance between the id and superego creates anxiety and is the cause of mental disorders. One way in which the mind resolves these conflicts is via defence mechanisms.
According to Freud, normal development in childhood involves passing through five psychosexual stages. At each stage, a conflict must be resolved before moving on to the next stage. If a conflict is not resolved, the child becomes stuck at that stage, which affects their behaviour as an adult."
"120","An example of getting stuck: If you’ve ever heard someone describe a person as ‘anal’ and thought it was a weird word to describe someone who’s obsessive about detail, it comes from Freud. According to the theory, if toilet training is too strict, it can manifest as a (anal retentive) personality that is obsessive about details, tidiness, routine, etc. If toilet training is too relaxed, it manifests the opposite personality (anal expulsive), i.e. messy and disorganised.
Another famous example of psychosexual conflict is the Oedipus complex, which occurs at the phallic stage. According to Freud, boys develop a sexual attraction towards their mother during this stage and a hatred of their father."
"121","Note: This topic is A level only, you don’t need to learn about humanistic psychology if you are taking the AS exam only.
Humanistic psychology rejects scientific and objective explanations of behaviour, instead arguing that human experience is subjective and that humans have free will to choose their behaviour.
Free will is the philosophical view that humans are able to make choices for themselves – without being controlled by the influences of biology or environment. It is a key assumption of the humanistic approach. Humanistic psychologists see humans as free to change and make decisions that lead to self-actualisation."
"122","The humanistic approach believes all humans have a desire to achieve self-actualisation. Self-actualisation means fulfilling your potential – developing your abilities and skills, successfully deploying them, and enjoying doing so. Because each human is different, self-actualisation will differ from person to person.
Maslow’s (1943) view of self-actualisation involves satisfying 5 levels in a hierarchy of needs.
At the bottom of the hierarchy are the most essential physiological needs – without things like food, water, and air to breathe, you die. The next most essential needs are safety (e.g. having a home), followed by social (e.g. having friends and romantic relationships), and then esteem needs (e.g. a job you are good at)."
"123","These lower levels of the hierarchy are deficiency needs. A person without these basic needs is lacking and must address them before they can reach the final stage of the hierarchy: self-actualisation.
Self-actualisation is a growth need. It involves fulfilling your full creative, moral, and intellectual potential. A self-actualising person is one who is constantly striving towards and achieving a worthy goal. Maslow gave various examples of self-actualised people, including Albert Einstein, but believed only around 1% of people truly achieve self-actualisation."
"124","Rogers’ view of self-actualisation builds on Maslow’s hierarchy. According to Rogers, self-actualisation also involves unconditional positive regard and congruence between how a person sees themself and their ideal version of themself.
Rogers argues that self-actualisation requires positive self-regard (i.e. a positive opinion of yourself).
But if a person’s parents impose conditions of worth on them, them are less likely to have positive self-regard. For example, if a parent only praises and loves their child when they do well in school, or win competitions, then their love is conditional. This can cause feelings of low self-esteem and worthlessness that prevent self-actualisation."
"125","In contrast, children whose parents have unconditional positive regard for them are more easily able to achieve self-actualisation.
Congruence refers to how closely two things overlap.
According to Rogers, self-actualisation requires that a person’s self-image (how they view themself) is highly congruent with, i.e. similar to, their ideal self (how they would like to be).
If the gap between a person’s self-image and their ideal self is too high (low congruence), it will be harder to achieve self-actualisation.
The humanistic approach has been influential on counselling therapy, which originated with Rogers."
"126","The humanistic approach has been influential on counselling therapy, which originated with Rogers.
The aim of Rogers’ counselling psychology (also called person-centred therapy) is to increase congruence between the client’s self-image and ideal self and increasing their feelings of self-worth. Ultimately, this helps the client to self-actualise and fulfil their potential. Note: A level students need to understand all these topics. AS students only need to understand the first 2 – i.e. they do not need to learn about the brain’s physiology or biological rhythms."
"127","The nervous system is the main system that controls the mind and body. It takes in information from the environment and elsewhere in the body (transmitted across neurons) and co-ordinates a wide range of conscious functions such as thinking and movement, as well as unconscious functions like the control of organs (e.g. heart rate, digestion) and glands."
"128","The central nervous system is the main control system of the body. It consists of two parts: the brain and spinal cord.
The spinal cord connects the brain with the peripheral nervous system. In other words, it connects the brain with the rest of the body and with the external world. The spinal cord is also responsible for some unconscious movements, such as reflexes (e.g. the one where you get hit on the knee and your leg kicks).
The peripheral nervous system goes beyond the central nervous system to connect it with the rest of the body and the external world. It consists of two parts: the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system."
"129","The somatic nervous system is responsible for voluntary movement (e.g. walking). It transmits information between the central nervous system and the senses (i.e. it connects the brain to the external world) and is under conscious control.
The autonomic nervous system is responsible for transmitting information between the central nervous system and the internal organs (i.e. it connects the brain to the rest of the body). Unlike the somatic nervous system, it is involuntary and not under conscious control.
In general, sympathetic functions increase bodily activity to prepare for action – an example of this is the fight or flight response. In contrast, parasympathetic functions decrease bodily activity to conserve energy."
"130","Neurons are the main components of the nervous system. They are how information is transmitted from one part of the nervous system to another. There are around 100 billion neurons in the brain and another 1 billion in the spinal cord."
"131","Signals are passed within neurons electrically. At rest, the neuron is negatively charged but becomes positively charged when activated, which sends an electrical impulse through the axon.
Once this electrical signal reaches the axon terminal, synaptic transmission enables the signal to pass along to the next neuron in the chain.
Neurons are separated by small gaps called synapses, and synaptic transmission is the process of sending information from one neuron to another.
The gap between two neurons is called the synaptic cleft (or synapse). When the electrical signal within a neuron reaches the axon terminal of that neuron, neurotransmitters are released from vesicles and cross over the synapse where they are taken up by receptors in the dendrites of the other neuron."
"132","Whereas signals within neurons are transmitted electrically, signals between neurons are transmitted chemically. In other words, neurotransmitters are chemicals. When a neurotransmitter is taken up by the receptor of the next neuron, it is converted back to an electrical signal which passes along the axon of that neuron until it reaches the axon terminal where the chain can continue.
For example, serotonin has a generally inhibitory effect. When serotonin binds to the receptor of a neuron, it increases the negative charge of that neuron, making it less likely to fire. In contrast, glutamate has an excitatory effect. So, if glutamate outweighs serotonin in a neuron, the net effect is increased likelihood of that neuron firing."
"133","The endocrine system is a system of glands that are responsible for the release of hormones. The pituitary gland (the ‘master gland’) of the endocrine system is linked to the nervous system via the hypothalamus, which co-ordinates and regulates the release of hormones from glands."
"134","Hormones are chemicals that communicate information throughout the body. Different hormones are produced and released by different glands in the body.
The endocrine system transmits information chemically, and operates much more slowly than the nervous system. It is primarily regulated via the pituitary gland (the ‘master’ gland), which connects the endocrine system to the nervous system (via the hypothalamus).
You don’t need to remember all the specific glands and hormones and their effects for A level psychology. Instead, the main one the syllabus focuses on is adrenaline.
Note: This topic is A level only, you don’t need to learn about the brain’s physiology if you are taking the AS exam only."
"135","Early scientists tended to see the brain in a holistic way, meaning they saw all areas of the brain as used for all functions. More recent (i.e. >20th century) scientists now tend to take a more localised approach. Different areas of the brain appear to be responsible for different functions, and damaging these areas effects those functions.
The first way the brain can be divided is laterally, i.e. a left half and a right half. These halves are called hemispheres. Each of the two hemispheres can be further divided into four lobes: frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal."
"136","The two hemispheres are not symmetrical – they do different things. For example, the left hemisphere tends to be more involved in language processing, whereas the right hemisphere tends to be more involved in processing spatial relationships.
As a general rule, information from the left side of the body is processed by the right hemisphere and vice versa (contralateral). For example, damage to the motor cortex in the right hemisphere will affect the person’s ability to move their left side, and damage to the auditory cortex in the left hemisphere will affect a person’s hearing in their right ear.
The two hemispheres of the brain are connected by a bundle of nerve fibers called the corpus callosum."
"137","In rare cases of extreme epilepsy, a surgeon may cut the corpus callosum (corpus callosotomy), separating the right and left hemispheres from each other. This contains any epileptic seizures to just one side of the brain, reducing their severity.
Localisation of function refers to identifying specific areas of the brain that correspond to specific functions. For example, damage to the auditory cortex in the brain can damage hearing, whereas damage to the motor cortex may reduce a person’s ability to move. This suggests these functions are localised within these areas of the brain."
"138","The motor cortex of the brain is responsible for voluntary movement, such as walking. It is located in the frontal lobes of each hemisphere. However, basic involuntary movements (like coughing) are controlled by other parts of the brain.
So, damage to the motor cortex may limit a person’s motor skills. For example, a person with a damaged motor cortex may have difficulty holding a pen.
The somatosensory cortex of the brain is responsible for sensing physical sensations on the skin, like pressure and heat. It is located in the parietal lobes of each hemisphere."
"139","The number of neurons in the somatosensory cortex differs according to body part. For example, there are many more neuronal connections dedicated to processing information from the hands than the ankles because people use their hands to feel things much more commonly than they do their ankles.
The visual cortex of the brain is responsible for processing visual information from the eyes. It is located in the occipital lobes of each hemisphere. The visual cortex is contralateral: The right hemisphere processes data from the left of a person’s field of vision (both eyes) and vice versa.
So, damage to the visual cortex of the right hemisphere may make it difficult for a person to perceive objects to the left of them."
"140","The auditory cortex of the brain is responsible for processing sound. It is located in the temporal lobes of each hemisphere. The auditory cortex is also contralateral: The right hemisphere processes sound from a person’s left ear and vice versa.
So, damage to the auditory cortex of the left hemisphere may cause hearing difficulties in a person’s right ear.
As mentioned, language processing primarily happens in the left hemisphere. There are two areas that are particularly important for language: Broca’s area and Wernicke’s area."
"141","The Broca’s area is the main area where speech is produced. It is located in the frontal lobe of the left hemisphere.
The Broca’s area was identified by and named after Pierre Paul Broca in the mid 19th Century. From post-mortem autopsies, Broca observed that patients who’d had difficulty producing words had lesions (damage) in this area of the brain.
Damage to the Broca’s area causes Broca’s aphasia (also called expressive aphasia), a condition characterised by slow speech, lack of fluency, and an inability to find the right words. Despite difficulties producing speech, people with Broca’s aphasia often have normal language comprehension – i.e. they understand what others are saying."
"142","Another important (but separate) area for language is Wernicke’s area. The Wernicke’s area is primarily responsible for language comprehension (both written and spoken). It is located in the temporal lobe.
Damage to the Wernicke’s area causes Wernicke’s aphasia (also called receptive aphasia). Patients with Wernicke’s aphasia typically have no problems producing speech – they speak in a fluent and effortless way – but the content of what they say often lacks meaning."
"143","Just like how plastic can be moulded and shaped, so too can the brain: New neuronal connections can be formed and old ones removed. Neuroplasticity is this ability of the brain to change its physical structure to perform different functions.
In childhood, the brain is highly plastic. This plasticity enables infants and children to quickly learn new skills, adapt to their environment, and recover from brain injury. Neuroplasticity reduces with age, but still remains: Unused pathways are removed, commonly used pathways are strengthened, and new pathways can be formed.
There are many ways psychologists and scientists study the brain. These methods are used to better understand how the brain works (e.g. where functions are localised) and diagnose and treat illness."
"144","Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a form of brain scanning. It uses magnetic fields to measure blood flow and oxygenation in the brain.
When an area of the brain is highly active, that area needs more oxygen and greater blood flow to provide this oxygen. By measuring blood flow and oxygenation, fMRI scanners enable researchers to identify which areas of the brain are activated during certain tasks."
"145","The example fMRI scans above are from Ovaysikia et al (2011). In this study, the researchers measured brain activity during two tasks: Reading words and recognising facial expressions. As can be seen from the fMRI scan above, the different tasks increased brain activity in different areas.
An electroencephalogram (EEG) is a scan of the brain’s electrical activity. An EEG scan is performed by attaching electrodes to the scalp or by using a hat with electrodes attached.
The electrodes detect electrical activity in the brain cells beneath them. So, the more electrodes that are used in an EEG, the more complete a picture of brain activity the EEG can provide."
"146","Event-related potentials (ERPs) are closely related to EEG scans. They use the same equipment but use statistical techniques to measure changes in brain activity in response to a stimulus. For example, the EEG could initially provide a baseline picture of brain activity, then researchers could introduce a stimulus (e.g. giving a subject some food to eat) and use ERPs to determine how brain activity changed in response."
"147","A post-mortem is a physical examination of the brain after a person has died. By physically analysing a brain (for example, by weighing it, dissecting parts of it, and comparing it to neurotypical (‘normal’) brains) and cross-referencing this with the person’s behaviour in life (e.g. any psychological disorders the person had) the examiner can learn more about the causes of behaviours and psychological disorders.
An example of this is described above: From post-mortem analysis of the brains of patients with speaking difficulties, Pierre Paul Broca identified that the Broca’s area of the brain is important for speech production.
Note: This topic is A level only, you don’t need to learn about biological rhythms if you are taking the AS exam only."
"148","Circadian rhythms are biological cycles lasting approximately 24 hours. An example of a circadian rhythm is the sleep/wake cycle: You might cycle between sleeping for 8 hours when it gets dark and being awake for 16 hours during the day, for instance."
"149","Examples of endogenous pacemakers that control circadian rhythm include systems that release hormones such as melatonin, systems that regulate body temperature, and systems that control metabolism and digestion. The main system that controls circadian rhythms is the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN).
These internal processes are influenced by exogenous zeitgebers – perhaps the most obvious of which is sunlight. For example, the darkness of night is thought to trigger melatonin release, which makes you feel tired and want to go to bed.
Infradian rhythms are biological cycles lasting more than 24 hours. An example of an infradian rhythm is the human menstrual cycle: Women typically ovulate once every 28 days."
"150","As with circadian rhythms, infradian rhythms are controlled by endogenous pacemakers. For example, hormones such as estrogen and progesterone are crucial to the menstrual cycle.
Infradian rhythms can also be influenced by exogenous zeitgebers. For example, Stern and McClintock (1998) demonstrated that women’s menstrual cycles change when exposed to pheromones from other women.
One complete sleep cycle through all these stages will typically take around 90 minutes. So, during a full night’s sleep, a person may repeat this cycle four or five times. Note: Unlike all other sections across the 3 exam papers, research methods is worth 48 marks instead of 24. Not only that, the other sections often include a few research methods questions, so this topic is the most important on the syllabus!"
"151","Practice papers with A* answers book #2 contains five full exam papers with five research methods sections. These questions cover the different types of study, how findings are reported, and have several worked examples of those tricky maths questions! 
Example question: Design a matched pairs experiment the researchers could conduct to investigate differences in toy preferences between boys and girls. [12 marks]
Each of these methods has its strengths and weaknesses. Different methods may be better suited to different research studies."
"152","The experimental method looks at how variables affect outcomes. A variable is anything that changes between two situations (see below for the different types of variables). For example, Bandura’s Bobo the doll experiment looked at how changing the variable of the role model’s behaviour affected how the child played.
A matched pairs design is another form of independent groups design. Participants are selected. Then, the researchers recruit another group of participants one-by-one to match the characteristics of each member of the original group. This provides two groups that are relevantly similar and controls for differences between groups that might skew results. The experiment is then conducted as a normal independent groups design."
"153","The controlled environment of a laboratory experiment minimises the risk of other variables outside the researchers’ control skewing the results of the trial, making it more clear what (if any) the causal effects of a variable are. Because the environment is tightly controlled, any changes in outcome must be a result of a change in the variable.
However, the controlled nature of a laboratory experiment might reduce its ecological validity. Results obtained in an artificial environment might not translate to real-life. Further, participants may be influenced by demand characteristics: They know they are taking part in a test, and so behave how they think they’re expected to behave rather than how they would naturally behave."
"154","The observational method looks at and examines behaviour. For example, Zimbardo’s prison study observed how participants behaved when given certain social roles.
An observational study will use behavioural categories to prioritise which behaviours are recorded and ensure the different observers are consistent in what they are looking for.
Rather than writing complete descriptions of behaviours, the behaviours can be coded into categories. For example, IS = interacted with stranger, and AS = avoided stranger. Researchers can also create numerical ratings to categorise behaviour, like the anxiety rating example above."
"155","Inter-observer reliability: In order for observations to produce reliable findings, it is important that observers all code behaviour in the same way. For example, researchers would have to make it very clear to the observers what the difference between a ‘3’ on the anxiety scale above would be compared to a ‘7’. This inter-observer reliability avoids subjective interpretations of the different observers skewing the findings.
Note: Don’t get event and time sampling confused with participant sampling, which is how researchers select participants to study from a population.
Self-report methods get participants to provide information about themselves. Information can be obtained via questionnaires or interviews."
"156","A questionnaire is a standardised list of questions that all participants in a study answer. For example, Hazan and Shaver used questionnaires to collate self-reported data from participants in order to identify correlations between attachment as infants and romantic attachment as adults.
In an interview, participants are asked questions in person. For example, Bowlby interviewed 44 children when studying the effects of maternal deprivation.
Interviews can also be a cross between the two – these are called semi-structured interviews.
Note: This topic is A level only, you don’t need to learn about case studies if you are taking the AS exam only."
"157","Case studies are detailed investigations into an individual, a group of people, or an event. For example, the biopsychology page describes a case study of a young boy who had the left hemisphere of his brain removed and the effects this had on his language skills.
In a case study, researchers use many of the methods described above – observation, questionnaires, interviews – to gather data on a subject. However, because case studies are studies of a single subject, the data they provide is primarily qualitative rather than quantitative. This data is then used to build a case history of the subject. Researchers then interpret this case history to draw their conclusions.
Most case studies focus on unusual individuals, groups, and events."
"158","Most case studies focus on unusual individuals, groups, and events.
Many case studies are longitudinal. This means they take place over an extended time period, with researchers checking in with the subject at various intervals. For example, the case study of the boy who had his left hemisphere removed collected data on the boy’s language skills at ages 2.5, 4, and 14 to see how he progressed.
This section looks at how science works more generally – in particular how scientific studies are organised and reported. It also covers ways of evaluating a scientific study."
"159","Studies will usually have an aim. The aim of a study is a description of what the researchers are investigating and why. For example, “to investigate the effect of SSRIs on symptoms of depression” or “to understand the effect uniforms have on obedience to authority”.
Studies seek to test a hypothesis. The experimental/alternate hypothesis of a study is a testable prediction of what the researchers expect to happen.
Either the experimental/alternate hypothesis or the null hypothesis will be supported by the results of the experiment.
It’s often not possible or practical to conduct research on everyone your study is supposed to apply to. So, researchers use sampling to select participants for their study."
"160","For example, the target population (i.e. who the results apply to) of Asch’s conformity experiments is all humans – but Asch didn’t conduct the experiment on that many people! Instead, Asch recruited 123 males and generalised the findings from this sample to the rest of the population.
Researchers choose from different sampling techniques – each has strengths and weaknesses.
The random sampling method involves selecting participants from a target population at random – such as by drawing names from a hat or using a computer program to select them. This method means each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected and thus is not subject to any bias."
"161","The systematic sampling method involves selecting participants from a target population by selecting them at pre-set intervals. For example, selecting every 50th person from a list, or every 7th, or whatever the interval is.
The stratified sampling method involves dividing the population into relevant groups for study, working out what percentage of the population is in each group, and then randomly sampling the population according to these percentages.
For example, let’s say 20% of the population is aged 0-18, and 50% of the population is aged 19-65, and 30% of the population is aged >65. A stratified sample of 100 participants would randomly select 20x 0-18 year olds, 50x 19-65 year olds, and 30x people over 65."
"162","In addition to the variables actually being investigated (independent and dependent), there may be additional (unwanted) variables in the experiment. These additional variables are called extraneous variables.
Researchers must control for extraneous variables to prevent them from skewing the results and leading to false conclusions. When extraneous variables are not properly controlled for they are known as confounding variables."
"163","For example, if you’re studying the effect of caffeine on reaction times, it might make sense to conduct all experiments at the same time of day to prevent this extraneous variable from confounding the results. Reaction times change throughout the day and so if you test one group of subjects at 3pm and another group right before they go to bed, you may falsely conclude that the second group had slower reaction times.
Operationalisation of variables is where researchers clearly and measurably define the variables in their study."
"164","For example, an experiment on the effects of sleep (independent variable) on anxiety (dependent variable) would need to clearly operationalise each variable. Sleep could be defined by number of hours spent in bed, but anxiety is a bit more abstract and so researchers would need to operationalise (i.e. define) anxiety such that it can be quantified in a measurable and objective way.
If variables are not properly operationalised, the experiment cannot be properly replicated, experimenters’ subjective interpretations may skew results, and the findings may not be valid."
"165","A pilot study is basically a practice run of the proposed research project. Researchers will use a small number of participants and run through the procedure with them. The purpose of this is to identify any problems or areas for improvement in the study design before conducting the research in full. A pilot study may also give an early indication of whether the results will be statistically significant.
For example, if a task is too easy for participants, or it’s too obvious what the real purpose of an experiment is, or questions in a questionnaire are ambiguous, then the results may not be valid. Conducting a pilot study first may save time and money as it enables researchers to identify and address such issues before conducting the full study on thousands of participants."
"166","Peer review is a way of assessing the scientific credibility of a research paper before it is published in a scientific journal. The idea with peer review is to prevent false ideas and bad research from being accepted as fact.
It typically works as follows: The researchers submit their paper to the journal they want it to be published in, and the editor of that journal sends the paper to expert reviewers (i.e. psychologists who are experts in that area – the researchers’ ‘peers’) who evaluate the paper’s scientific validity. The reviewers may accept the paper as it is, accept it with a few changes, reject it and suggest revisions and resubmission at a later date, or reject it completely."
"167","In psychological studies, ethical issues are questions of what is morally right and wrong. An ethically-conducted study will protect the health and safety of the participants involved and uphold their dignity, privacy, and rights.
Study results are reliable if the same results can be consistently replicated under the same circumstances. If results are inconsistent then the study is unreliable.
Note: Just because a study is reliable, its results are not automatically valid. A broken tape measure may reliably (i.e. consistently) record a person’s height as 200m, but that doesn’t mean this measurement is accurate.
Test-retest is when you give the same test to the same person on two different occasions. If the results are the same or similar both times, this suggests they are reliable."
"168","For example, if your study used scales to measure participants’ weight, you would expect the scales to record the same (or a very similar) weight for the same person in the morning as in the evening. If the scales said the person weighed 100kg more later that same day, the scales (and therefore the results of the study) would be unreliable.
Inter-observer reliability is a way to test the reliability of observational studies.
For example, if your study required observers to assess participants’ anxiety levels, you would expect different observers to grade the same behaviour in the same way. If one observer rated a participant’s behaviour a 3 for anxiety, and another observer rated the exact same behaviour an 8, the results would be unreliable."
"169","Inter-observer reliability can be assessed mathematically by looking for correlation between observers’ scores. Inter-observer reliability can be improved by setting clearly defined behavioural categories.
There are several different types of extraneous variables that can reduce the validity of a study. A well-conducted psychological study will control for these extraneous variables so that they do not skew the results.
Demand characteristics are extraneous variables where the demands of a study make participants behave in ways they wouldn’t behave outside of the study. This reduces the study’s ecological validity."
"170","For example, if a participant guesses the purpose of an experiment they are taking part in, they may try to please the researcher by behaving in the ‘right’ way rather than the way they would naturally. Alternatively, the participant might rebel against the study and deliberately try to sabotage it (e.g. by deliberately giving wrong answers).
In some study designs, researchers can control for demand characteristics using single-blind methods. For example, a drug trial could give half the participants the actual drug and the other half a placebo but not tell participants which treatment they received. This way, both groups will have equal demand characteristics and so any differences between them should be down to the drug itself."
"171","Investigator effects are another extraneous variable where the characteristics of the researcher affect the participant’s behaviour. Again, this reduces the study’s ecological validity.
Many characteristics – e.g. the researcher’s age, gender, accent, what they’re wearing – could potentially influence the participant’s responses. For example, in an interview about sex, females may feel less comfortable answering questions asked by a male interviewer and thus give different answers than if they were asked by a female. The researcher’s biases may also come across in their body language or tone of voice, affecting the participant’s responses."
"172","In some study designs, researchers can control for demand characteristics using double-blind methods. In a double-blind drug trial, for example, neither the participants nor the researchers know which participants get the actual drug and which get the placebo. This way, the researcher is unable to give any clues (consciously or unconsciously) to participants that would affect their behaviour.
Participant variables are differences between participants. These can be controlled for by random allocation."
"173","For example, in an experiment on the effect of caffeine on reaction times, participants would be randomly allocated into either the caffeine group or the non-caffeine group. A non-random allocation method, such as allocating caffeine to men and placebo to women, could mean variables in the allocation method (in this case gender) skew the results. When participants are randomly allocated, any extraneous variables (e.g. gender in this case) will be allocated evenly between each group and so not skew the results of one group more than the other.
Situational variables are the environment the experiment is conducted in. These can be controlled for by standardisation."
"174","For example, all the tests of caffeine on reaction times would be conducted in the same room, at the same time of day, using the same equipment, and so on to prevent these features of the environment from skewing the results.
In a repeated measures experiment, researchers may use counterbalancing to control for the order in which tasks are completed.
For example, half of participants would do task A followed by task B, and the other half would do task B followed by task A.
Science works by making empirical observations of the world, formulating hypotheses/theories that explain these observations, and repeatedly testing these hypotheses/theories via experimentation."
"175","Philosopher Thomas Kuhn argues that science is not as unbiased and objective as it seems. Instead, the majority of scientists just accept the existing scientific theories (i.e. the existing paradigm) as true and then find data that supports these theories while ignoring/rejecting data that refutes them.
Rarely, though, minority voices are able to successfully challenge the existing paradigm and replace it with a new one. When this happens it is a paradigm shift. An example of a paradigm shift in science is that from Newtonian gravity to Einstein’s theory of general relativity."
"176","For example, some quantitative data in the Milgram experiment would be how many subjects delivered a lethal shock. In contrast, some qualitative data would be asking the subjects afterwards how they felt about delivering the lethal shock.
A meta-analysis is a study of studies. It involves taking several smaller studies within a certain research area and using statistics to identify similarities and trends within those studies to create a larger study.
We have looked at some examples of meta-analyses elsewhere in the course such as Van Ijzendoorn’s meta-analysis of several strange situation studies and Grootheest et al’s meta-analysis of twin studies on OCD."
"177","A good meta-analysis is often more reliable than a regular study because it is based on a larger data set, and any issues with one single study will be balanced out by the other studies.
Mean, median, and mode are measures of central tendency. In other words, they are ways of reducing large data sets into averages.
The mean is calculated by adding all the numbers in a set together and dividing the total by the number of numbers.
The median is calculated by arranging all the numbers in a set from smallest to biggest and then finding the number in the middle. Note: If the total number of numbers is odd, you just pick the middle one. But if the total number of numbers is even, you take the mid-point between the two numbers in the middle."
"178","The mode is calculated by counting which is the most commonly occurring number in a set.
Range and standard deviation are measures of dispersion. In other words, they quantify how much scores in a data set vary.
The range is calculated by subtracting the smallest number in the data set from the largest number.
Note: This method of standard deviation is based on the entire population. There is a slightly different method for calculating based on a sample where instead of dividing by the number of numbers in the second to last step, you divide by the number of numbers-1 (in this case 4314/9=479.333). This gives a standard deviation of 21.89."
"179","A data set that has a normal distribution will have the majority of scores on or near the mean average. A normal distribution is also symmetrical: There are an equal number of scores above the mean as below it. In a normal distribution, scores become rarer and rarer the more they deviate from the mean."
"180","When plotted on a histogram, data that follows a normal distribution will form a bell-shaped curve like the one above.
A data set that has a skewed distribution will not be symmetrical: Scores are not distributed evenly either side of the mean.
Correlation refers to how closely related two (or more) things are related. For example, hot weather and ice cream sales may be positively correlated: When hot weather goes up, so do ice cream sales."
"181","Tables are ways of presenting data. They can present raw data (data tables) or summarise results (results tables).
For example, the behavioural categories table above presents the raw data of each student in this made-up study. But in the results section, researchers might include another table that compares average anxiety rating scores for males and females."
"182","A scattergram illustrates two variables for various data points.
For example, each dot on the correlation scattergram opposite could represent a student. The x-axis could represent the number of hours the student studied, and the y-axis could represent the student’s test score.
A bar chart illustrates discrete data categories for comparison. The x-axis lists the categories and the y-axis illustrates the different results between the categories.
For example, the results of Loftus and Palmer’s study into the effects of different leading questions on memory could be presented using the bar chart above. It’s not like there are categories in-between ‘contacted’ and ‘hit’, so the bars have gaps between them (unlike a histogram)."
"183","A histogram is a bit like a bar chart but is used to illustrate continuous or interval data (rather than discrete data or whole numbers).
For example, it’s not like you can only weigh 100kg or 101kg – there are many intervals in between. The x axis on the histogram opposite organises this continuous data (i.e. the in-between scores) into categories. The y axis illustrates the frequency of scores within each category.
Because the data on the x axis is continuous, there are no gaps between the bars.
Like a histogram, a line graph (sometimes called a frequency polygon) also illustrates continuous data. But whereas a histogram can only represent one data category, a line graph can illustrate multiple data categories."
"184","For example, the line graph above illustrates 3 different people’s progression in a strength training program over time.
Pie charts illustrate how commonly different things occur relative to each other. In other words, they provide a visual representation of percentages.
For example, the frequency with which different attachment styles occurred in Ainsworth’s strange situation could be represented by the pie chart opposite.
The point of inferential testing is to see whether a study’s results are statistically significant, i.e. whether any observed effects are as a result of whatever is being studied rather than just random chance."
"185","For example, let’s say you are studying whether flipping a coin outdoors increases the likelihood of getting heads. You flip the coin 100 times and get 52 heads and 48 tails. Assuming a baseline expectation of 50:50, you might take these results to mean that flipping the coin outdoors does increase the likelihood of getting heads. However, from 100 coin flips, a ratio of 52:48 between heads and tails is not very significant and could have occurred due to luck. So, the probability that this difference in heads and tails is because you flipped the coin outside (rather than just luck) is low."
"186","Probability is denoted by the symbol p. The lower the p value, the more statistically significant your results are. You can never get a p value of 0, though, so researchers will set a threshold at which point the results are considered statistically significant enough to reject the null hypothesis. In psychology, this threshold is usually <0.05, which means there is a less than 5% chance the observed effect is due to luck and a >95% chance it is a real effect.
Increasing the sample size reduces the likelihood of type 1 and type 2 errors.
Key maths skills made easy!"
"187","Key maths skills made easy!
The research methods section of the colourful and concise revision guide includes simple explanations and worked examples of all the key mathematical and statistical skills needed for exam success, including: Which statistical test to use, how to use critical values tables, the sign test, and standard deviation.
Note: The inferential tests below are needed for A level only, if you are taking the AS exam, you only need to know the sign test.
The sign test is a way to calculate the statistical significance of differences between related pairs (e.g. before and after in a repeated measures experiment) of nominal data. If the observed value (s) is equal or less than the critical value (cv), the results are statistically significant."
"188","Example: Let’s say we ran an experiment on 10 participants to see whether they prefer movie A or movie B. The different approaches in psychology often come down on one side or the other in each of these debates. For example, the humanistic approach believes in free will whereas the biological approach is highly deterministic. These debates also feed into the other issues and options topics that follow."
"189","Beta bias within psychology can lead to androcentrism: A perspective where male psychology and behaviours are viewed as the default and normal. For example, in the stress example above, female tend and befriend behaviours could be viewed as abnormal because they deviate from typical male (fight or flight) behaviours. However, such behaviours are only abnormal from an androcentric perspective – when studies take account of differences between genders the tend and befriend behaviours are seen as normal.
Gender bias can occur for a variety of reasons.
For example, researchers may have pre-conceived gender stereotypes that affect how they treat participants, resulting in investigator effects."
"190","Further, publication bias could cause alpha bias. If a study finds no differences between genders then this may be seen as less psychologically interesting than a study that finds a big difference between genders, making studies that find differences between genders more likely to get published. This results in a publication bias towards studies that emphasise differences between genders.
An imposed etic is an example of cultural bias and can lead to ethnocentrism: A perspective where the behaviours of a certain ethnicity or culture are seen as the default and normal. As such, any behaviour that deviates from the norms of that culture may be seen as abnormal."
"191","For example, Ainsworth’s studies of infant attachment only looked at American infants and concluded that secure attachment styles are most psychologically healthy. From this perspective, child-rearing practices in other countries may be seen as unhealthy or abnormal rather than simply different. For example, the American perspective might see German parents as cold and rejecting. But from the German perspective, American parents may seem overly coddling, preventing the child from becoming independent."
"192","Etic research is not automatically bad. The point of much of psychology is to uncover universal (nomothetic) laws of human behaviour. And given that all humans in all cultures have very similar biology, there are likely to be many universal psychological truths. But if researchers assume their culture is the default (imposed etic), that’s where the bias comes in.
Psychological research can avoid cultural bias by being conscious of cultural relativism, i.e. differences between cultures."
"193","Psychological studies often face ethical issues. Ethical issues in the design of the study itself are covered in the research methods section. However, a psychological study and its findings may have ethical implications that go beyond the participants directly involved to affect society more generally – particularly if the research is socially sensitive.
Researchers must weigh up these concerns against the potential benefits. In some cases, psychologists argue that even if a study causes harm it should still be conducted because the knowledge gained is so valuable (e.g. Milgram)."
"194","There are differing opinions within psychology on the question of whether humans have free will – i.e., whether humans are able to freely choose their behaviours. The opposite of free will is determinism, which says that human behaviours are caused by physical processes and that these physical processes cannot be overruled.
Humanistic psychology, for example, believes humans do have free will. While physical factors – e.g. genetics and environment – influence our behaviours, humanistic psychologists believe humans are able to transcend these physical factors and make free choices."
"195","Soft determinism could represent an in-between approach to the free will vs. determinism debate. For example, Bandura’s social learning theory has elements of both: Although we often imitate the behaviours of our environment (environmental determinism), one could argue that mediating processes (e.g. attention and motivation) represent an opportunity for free will to play a part. In other words, we can choose which behaviours we pay attention to and choose to reflect on whether we are motivated to reproduce them and why.
The nature vs. nurture debate is about how much our behaviour is determined by genetics/biology and how much is determined by environment."
"196","At one extreme, nativists believe our behaviour is pre-determined by nature. Nativists believe our behaviour is explained by heredity – i.e. inherited biological characteristics such as genetics.
Twin studies provide a way to assess the heritability of behaviour. Monozygotic twins have identical genetics and so, if nativism was 100% correct, you would expect them to behave identically too. However, monozygotic twins often have different personalities and preferences, suggesting environment plays a role in behaviour too.
The biological approach to psychology can be said to support the nature side of the debate. For example, the studies above suggest genetics play an important role in various behaviours and psychological traits."
"197","At the other extreme, empiricists believe humans are born as blank slates with no innate nature. So, because humans don’t come with any pre-programmed traits or nature, any behaviour must be learned from the environment.
The learning approach to psychology leans towards the nurture side of the debate. Skinner, for example, explained behaviours as a result of operant conditioning and so different conditioning leads to different behaviour (regardless of genetics). For example, if someone who learned to do their homework because of positive reinforcement did not receive that positive reinforcement, then they would have behaved differently (i.e. not done their homework)."
"198","The interactionist approach lies somewhere between the two: Our genetic nature predisposes us towards some behaviours more than others, but how these genes are expressed is often dependent on environment. This goes back to the difference between genotype and phenotype."
"199","There are several examples of this elsewhere in the course. For example, OCD has a strong genetic component but not everyone with these genes goes on to develop OCD. For example, some people may take drugs that suppress OCD symptoms, others may overcome OCD with cognitive behavioural therapy, and some people with a genetic disposition towards OCD may simply never experience events that trigger OCD symptoms. And although twin studies support the existence of a genetic component to OCD, the heritability coefficient is less than 0.7; there are many instances where just one twin develops OCD but not the other."
"200","One mechanism through which environment interacts with genetics is epigenetics. Lifestyle choices (e.g. smoking) and environmental effects (e.g. living in an area with air pollution) ‘switch on’ certain genes and ‘switch off’ others. Although epigenetic effects do not alter a person’s DNA sequence itself, there is some evidence they can alter the genes they pass on to their children.
Realistically, psychologists on both sides of the nature vs. nurture debate are interactionists – it’s clear that both genetics and environment have effects on behaviour. The debate, then, is to what extent nature determines behaviour and to what extent nurture does."
"201","The holism vs. reductionism debate is about levels of explanation: Whether psychology should seek to understand a person’s behaviour as a whole or whether behaviours can be broken down and explained in terms of smaller parts."
"202","Holism sees multiple levels of explanation as valuable whereas reductionism thinks psychological phenomena can be entirely explained (without losing any valuable details) using just one of these levels of explanation.
Extreme reductionist explanations break behaviours down into a single cause. An example of a reductionist explanation would be something like: Depression is caused by low serotonin.
The biological approach to psychology leans heavily towards reductionism (biological reductionism). For example, a proponent of this approach might argue that behaviour can be explained entirely in terms of physical/biological causes without reference to higher levels of explanation, such as a person’s upbringing or cognitions."
"203","Similarly, the behaviourist approach can be reductionist (environmental reductionism). For example, an extreme behaviourist might explain behaviour solely in terms of conditioning without reference to lower levels of explanation such as the underlying biology.
Holistic approaches look at the person as a whole to explain their behaviour. For example, a holistic explanation of depression will consider the person’s genetics and biology but also their experiences, upbringing, and the general social context and culture in which they live. Advocates of holism believe human behaviour is too complex to be fully explained from one level of explanation and that “the whole is greater than the sum of its parts”."
"204","The humanistic approach is arguably the most holistic approach to psychology. It treats every person as a unique individual that cannot be reduced to general explanations. The humanistic approach to psychological treatment is similarly holistic: It seeks to address and improve all aspects of the person.
Again, you don’t have to dogmatically come down on either the reductionist or the holism side but can instead opt for an in-between approach. For example, you could argue that in some situations several levels of explanation are best and in others a single level is best. You could argue there is no one-size-fits-all answer as both holism and reductionism are useful for different things."
"205","The nomothetic vs. idiographic debate is about whether the best approach to psychology is to look at similarities between humans or the differences that make them unique.
The nomothetic approach (‘nomos’ = ‘law’) to psychology seeks to identify general laws of human behaviour by looking at similarities between people and groups of people."
"206","Classifications are a form of nomothetic generalisation. For example, the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders provides ways to categorise people as having mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, personality disorders, etc. Similarly, several nomothetic ways to categorise personality types exist such as the five-factor model of personality, the Myers-Briggs type indicator, and astrological star signs.
Principles are another form of nomothetic generalisation. For example, behaviourism describes general laws through which behaviours are conditioned, such as operant and classical conditioning. Similarly, cognitive approaches try to develop theoretical models that explain human behaviour."
"207","The idiographic approach (‘idios’ = ‘distinct self’) seeks to understand the individual as a unique being without comparing them to others. The idiographic approach believes that the uniqueness of each person means it is difficult/impossible to identify general laws that apply across populations."
"208","Again, as always, you can take an in-between approach between idiographic and nomothetic. For example, you can start with a nomothetic approach and identify general laws – as long as you recognise that these general laws do not apply to everyone. Once the general laws are established, you can take a more idiographic approach and study the unique ways people deviate from these laws. This second way is known as sexual selection. Evolutionary (socio-biological) explanations of relationships look at the different sexual selection pressures between men and women to provide psychological explanations of relationships.
Anisogamy refers to the differences between male sex cells (sperm) and female sex cells (ova, or eggs)."
"209","These two strategies conflict with each other, which results in different reproductive behaviours between men and women.
The characterisations of male and female reproductive behaviours above are extreme generalisations. There are obvious exceptions, e.g. highly monogamous men and highly promiscuous women.
Attraction is a key part of romantic relationships. There are several factors that affect attraction such as physical attractiveness, similarity of attitudes, and self-disclosure.
Self-disclosure is when you reveal personal and intimate information about yourself to another person. This creates feelings of intimacy and trust in relationships."
"210","Altman and Taylor’s (1973) social penetration theory describes the process of self-disclosure in relationships. Both the breadth (i.e. the range of topics) and the depth of self-disclosures is important.
Initially, disclosures will cover a narrow range of basic topics in a shallow way – you talk about what you do for a living, your hobbies, etc. As the relationship develops, the breadth of topics and depth of disclosure increases. For example, you talk about more controversial or intimate topics, share painful or embarrassing memories, and maybe reveal some secrets. Altman and Taylor liken this process to peeling away the layers of an onion: You start at the surface and peel away until you get to the core of the person."
"211","Self-disclosure is important in the development of a relationship as it establishes trust and intimacy. However, too much self-disclosure too quickly tends to have the opposite effect: Altman and Taylor found that revealing intimate details too early on (e.g. talking about childhood trauma on a first date) is unattractive.
Physical attractiveness is often the first part of attraction. Getting to know someone’s personality and values takes time, but physical characteristics provide an immediate way to select potential partners."
"212","We covered some evolutionary explanations of physical attractiveness above. According to this explanation, men are attracted to physical characteristics that indicate fertility in females, such as youth and a low waist-to-hip ratio. Although physical attractiveness in partners seems less important to women than men, women are also attracted to physical features that indicate genetic fitness, such as high shoulder-to-hip ratio."
"213","A common physical attribute attractive to both males and females is facial symmetry. Shackelford and Larsen (1997) found that people with symmetrical faces are consistently rated as more attractive than people with asymmetric faces. The evolutionary explanation of this is that symmetry is a reliable indicator of fitness because it requires genetic precision and an environment of abundance during development.
Physical attractiveness often makes us see people as attractive in other ways through the halo effect. The halo effect is a bias where we assume attractive people have attractive personalities too. For example, Dion et al (1972) found that subjects rated physically attractive people as more sociable and more successful in their careers."
"214","Walster et al’s (1966) matching hypothesis says that we choose partners who are similar in physical attractiveness to ourselves. For example, if you rate yourself 7/10, you’ll go for a partner who is also 7/10.
There is an evolutionary element to the matching hypothesis. While it might be desirable to form relationships with the most attractive people, it is not always realistic. If people only went for partners out of their league, they might never find a partner and thus never pass on their genes. So, people assess their own attractiveness and seek out partners who ‘match’ their own level of attractiveness to increase their chances of relationship success."
"215","There are three theories of relationships listed on the syllabus: Social exchange theory, equity theory and Rusbult’s investment model. The syllabus also lists Duck’s phase model, which is a theory of relationship breakdown.
Social exchange theory is the name for a range of theories that view romantic relationships economically in terms of costs vs. benefits."
"216","According to social exchange theories, humans are selfish and so engage in romantic relationships in order to get some benefit. Partners weigh the costs of being in the relationship (e.g. time, effort, loss of freedom, stress) against the benefits (e.g. companionship, help, gifts, sex). If the benefits outweigh the costs, the relationship is ‘profitable’ and there is a desire to maintain it. However, if the costs outweigh the benefits for one of the partners, that partner will break the relationship off as it is no longer profitable to them."
"217","In addition to the ‘profitability’ of the current relationship (comparison level), there is the potential profitability of alternative relationships (comparison level for alternatives). If a partner judges an alternative relationship to be more profitable than the current one, they may break off the current relationship – even if it is profitable – to pursue a more profitable alternative relationship.
The equity theory of romantic relationships is about fairness between the partners."
"218","The equity theory of romantic relationships is about fairness between the partners.
According to equity theory, relationships are successful if each partner equally bears the same amount of costs and benefits. If one partner is benefiting from the relationship more than the other, this is seen as unfair and leads to relationship dissatisfaction on both sides: The underbenefiting partner may feel angry that they are making all this effort and getting little in return, whereas the overbenefiting partner may feel shame and guilt. So, whereas social exchange theory sees people as selfishly trying to maximise their own benefits in a relationship, equity theory sees people as trying to maximise equity (fairness)."
"219","Equity theory predicts that inequity (unfairness) is correlated with relationship dissatisfaction.
Rusbult’s (1980, 1983) investment model of relationships includes elements of social exchange theory but also considers each partner’s investment in the relationship.
Unlike the other theories above, Duck’s phase model is not a model of relationships but a model of relationship breakdown (dissolution).
According to Duck’s phase model, relationship breakdown is not a one-off event but a process that happens in four stages. Each stage marks a ‘threshold’ at which point the perception of the relationship changes. If the partner does not feel there has been enough change, they may cross the threshold of the next stage, increasing the likelihood of a break-up."
"220","Virtual relationships are relationships between people who are connected virtually rather than physically. The internet – social media in particular – enables people to form these relationships, which differ from ordinary physical relationships in terms of self-disclosure and the absence of gating.
Differences between virtual and face-to-face communication may lead to greater levels of self-disclosure in virtual relationships than in face-to-face interactions."
"221","Anonymity in virtual relationships may increase self-disclosure. Unlike face-to-face interactions, virtual relationships may be conducted anonymously (e.g. via anonymous forums and burner accounts). This anonymity may increase self-disclosure compared to real-life, as anonymity protects the individual from potential negative social consequences of self-disclosing private or intimate information.
Unlike face-to-face interactions, many forms of virtual communication (e.g. direct messaging, email) do not include cues such as body language and tone of voice. This may lead to increased self-disclosure."
"222","Sproull and Kiesler (1986) proposed that the reduction in non-verbal cues from virtual interactions may make individuals less likely to self-disclose. However, Walther’s (1996) hyperpersonal model suggests the opposite: Non-verbal cues distract from the content of the communication and so removing them in virtual contexts enables the sender to focus more on how they present themselves, enabling superior (‘hyperpersonal’) communication. The hyperpersonal model is further supported by Jiang et al (2010), who found that disclosure and intimacy were higher in text-based virtual interactions than in face-to-face ones."
"223","Another difference between virtual and face-to-face interactions is the absence of gating. This means that factors that might have prevented a relationship forming in real life (i.e. gates to that relationship) are not present in the virtual context.
McKenna and Bargh (1999) give several examples of potential ‘gates’ that might prevent a person from forming face-to-face relationships. Such examples include facial disfigurement, a stammer, or extreme shyness of social anxiety. However, in the virtual context, these gates do not exist and so a person may be able to form relationships with people who might otherwise reject them because of these reasons."
"224","Similarly, the social demography filter of filter theory is less likely to serve as a gate in virtual relationships. For example, the internet means people can communicate and maintain relationships over large distances, and with people outside their social class or ethnicity.
Parasocial relationships are one-sided relationships where a person gets attached to someone they don’t know in real life. For example, someone might engage in a parasocial relationship with a celebrity or social media star.
The syllabus lists two explanations of parasocial relationships: The absorption-addiction model and the attachment theory explanation."
"225","McCutcheon et al (2002) proposed the absorption-addiction model of parasocial relationships. According to this model, people engage in parasocial relationships to compensate for deficiencies in their lives.
For example, a person whose life is boring may follow a celebrity’s life in order to ‘absorb‘ some of the fun they experience. Or similarly, a person who feels unsuccessful in their own life may follow a famous person’s life and absorb the feeling of their success."
"226","However, the person may become addicted to these vicarious feelings. When this happens, the person may need to increase the ‘dose’ in a manner similar to physical addiction in order to get the same positive feelings as before. This can lead to the irrational behaviour and delusional fantasies typical of the borderline-pathological level of parasocial relationship.
An alternative explanation of parasocial relationships is attachment theory. Whereas the absorption-addiction model explains parasocial relationships as a way to compensate for deficiencies in one’s life, attachment theory explains parasocial relationships as a consequence of issues in early attachment."
"227","If you remember from the attachment topic, Ainsworth identified three infant attachment styles: Secure, insecure-avoidant, and insecure-resistant. According to the attachment explanation of parasocial relationships, individuals with insecure-resistant attachment styles in infancy are most likely to engage in parasocial relationships when they grow up. The reasoning behind this is that insecure-resistant infants still desire to form emotional connections (unlike insecure-avoidant infants) but do not want to risk the possibility of rejection that comes with ordinary social relationships. Parasocial relationships thus provide a way for people with insecure-resistant attachment styles to experience the positive emotions of a relationship without the risk of rejection that comes with typical"
"228","the positive emotions of a relationship without the risk of rejection that comes with typical social relationships. The different sexes have different sex-role stereotypes. If someone has a mix of masculine and feminine traits, they are androgynous."
"229","Some sex-role stereotypes are valid. For example, the stereotype that men are more aggressive than women is likely to reflect a valid biological difference between the sexes. However, many stereotypes, such as women wearing skirts and men wearing trousers, have no basis in biology and are entirely created by culture.
Androgyny is when someone has a mix of both feminine and masculine traits. It is commonly used to refer to someone’s appearance (e.g. a female with short hair or a man wearing makeup), but in this context we are talking about psychological androgyny.
Androgyny can be measured using the Bem sex-role inventory."
"230","Androgyny can be measured using the Bem sex-role inventory.
Bem (1974) created the Bem sex-role inventory to measure a person’s masculine and feminine traits. It is a self-report method that asks participants to rate themselves on a scale of 1-7 for 60 items (20 masculine, 20 feminine, 20 neutral). You can see the full list here.
Bem argues that androgyny – scoring highly for both masculinity and femininity – is psychologically healthy and advantageous. One reason androgyny may be advantageous is that having a mix of masculine and feminine traits enables a person to adapt and excel in more situations, whereas a person who scores highly one way but not the other is likely to have a more limited skillset."
"231","Chromosomes (genetics) determine a person’s biological sex, which influences their natural hormone levels. In addition to physical effects, these biological factors have psychological effects that influence gender development.
Each cell in the body (with a few exceptions) has chromosomes, which carry genetic information. Humans have 46 chromosomes, or 23 pairs. The 23rd chromosome pair determines a person’s biological sex.
Females have two pairs of X chromosomes, whereas males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. It is genes in the Y chromosome that are responsible for male development, such as the formation of testes and higher levels of the hormone testosterone."
"232","Atypical sex chromosome patterns are when a person has a 23rd chromosome pair that is something other than the typical XX pattern for females or XY pattern for males. These atypical sex chromosome patterns cause differences in development compared those with typical sex chromosome patterns.
Klinefelter’s syndrome (also known as 47,XXY) is when a male is born with XXY chromosomes rather than XY sex chromosomes. It affects roughly one in 750 males.
Turner’s syndrome (also known as 45,X) is when a female is born with only one X chromosome and either an absent or partial second X chromosome. It affects roughly one in 5,000 females.
Hormones are chemicals produced in the body by glands (see the biopsychology page for more details)."
"233","All humans produce the same hormones – but males and females produce them in different amounts. For example, men produce much higher levels of testosterone, whereas women produce much more estrogen. In the womb, the different levels of these hormones affect brain development and cause the development of either male or female genitals. At puberty, hormone levels increase, causing the development of secondary sex characteristics (e.g. development of breasts in women, growth of facial hair in men). Hormones are associated with sex-role behavioural stereotypes and so are an important influence on gender development."
"234","Testosterone is the primary sex hormone in males. On average, men have around 10 times as much testosterone as women. These higher testosterone levels have psychological effects that contribute to gender differences."
"235","During development in the womb, genes in the Y chromosome cause testes, rather than ovaries, to form. At around 8 weeks, the testes start producing testosterone. This testosterone causes physical changes, such as the development of male sex organs, and also psychological ones because prenatal testosterone causes masculinisation of the brain. For example, men typically have greater spatial reasoning than women, with animal studies (e.g. Williams and Meck (1991)) and studies of females exposed to high levels of prenatal testosterone (e.g. Puts et al (2008)) suggesting testosterone plays a role in developing these areas of the brain."
"236","After birth, testosterone is associated with stereotypical male behaviours, such as aggression and competitiveness. For example, Albert et al (1989) found injecting female rats with testosterone made them act more aggressively. In humans, Dabbs et al (1995) studied a prison population, finding prisoners with higher testosterone levels were more likely to have committed violent crimes.
There are several estrogen (also spelt oestrogen) hormones within the human body, the most common of which is estradiol. Estrogens are associated with female development, with women typically having 10 times as much estradiol as men. These higher estrogen levels contribute to gender differences."
"237","In the womb, having an X chromosome instead of Y means ovaries, rather than testes, form. This results in higher estrogen levels and lower testosterone levels. These higher estrogen levels have feminising effects on brain development. For example, some studies (e.g. Ardekani et al (2013)) have found women have more neural connections between the left and right hemispheres than men, resulting in more evenly distributed use of both brain hemispheres. Further, women generally have greater verbal fluency than men, with some studies (e.g. Schultheiss et al (2020)) suggesting this is a result of estrogen exposure."
"238","Estrogen is associated with stereotypical female behaviours, such as compassion and sensitivity. After puberty, estrogen also regulates the menstrual cycle in women. In some women, hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle cause pre-menstrual syndrome (PMS) – a condition with psychological symptoms that include stress, anxiety, and irritability. However, some researchers (e.g. Rodin (1992) and Offman and Kleinplatz (2004)) criticise the characterisation of PMS as a medical disorder.
Oxytocin is sometimes called the ‘love hormone’ because it is associated with bonding, nurturing, trust, and sociability. Oxytocin levels are typically higher in women than men and the effects of oxytocin are amplified by estrogen, so oxytocin contributes to gender differences."
"239","Oxytocin plays an important role in childbirth by causing contractions. After the baby is born, oxytocin stimulates lactation to enable breastfeeding. Oxytocin also helps form an emotional bond between mother and baby."
"240","Oxytocin may partly explain sex-role stereotypes to do with childcare, sociability, and relationships. For example, oxytocin levels increase during sex by roughly 5 times – for both men and women – but fall immediately in males after orgasm. This may explain why males are less interested in intimacy after sex. Another example is gender differences in behavioural responses to stress. Typically characterised as ‘fight or flight‘, Taylor et al (2000) found the female response to stress is better characterised as ‘tend and befriend’. The researchers suggest these behavioural differences in response to stress are caused by differences in oxytocin activity between men and women. In another study, Zak et al (2007) randomly assigned participants to receive either an oxytocin injection or placebo"
"241","Zak et al (2007) randomly assigned participants to receive either an oxytocin injection or placebo before getting the participants to take part in a task that involved splitting money with another person. The participants injected with oxytocin were 80% more generous than controls."
"242","Cognitive explanations of gender development see gender resulting from active changes in thought over time as a child grows up (as opposed to social learning theory, which says gender is just passively observed and imitated). They describe the ways of thinking that contribute to gender development.
The cognitive explanations of gender included in the syllabus are Kohlberg’s theory and gender schema theory.
Piaget’s theory of cognitive development (see the cognition and development page for more details) argues that children’s thinking changes as they grow up. Kohlberg’s theory of gender development is based on this model, arguing that gender development occurs alongside general development in thinking that comes with age."
"243","In the case of gender development specifically, Kohlberg (1966) identifies 3 stages: Gender identity, gender stability, and gender constancy.
After the child reaches gender constancy, they seek out and imitate role models who match their gender. For example, a boy may take an interest in football if he identifies with his father who is also interested in football.
Martin and Halverson (1981) and Bem (1981) argue that children start developing gender schema – mental frameworks to understand gender – at around 2-3 years old. For example, a boy might develop the schema that “dolls are a girl’s toy”. These schema are used to make sense of the world and also affect how the child behaves. For example, the boy will play with toy trucks and not dolls."
"244","This gender schema theory differs from Kohlberg’s theory in that it argues children behave in gendered ways from a much earlier age. Whereas Kohlberg argues that children start imitating gender-appropriate role models at around 6 years old (after reaching gender constancy), gender schema theory proposes that children start developing gender schemas from around age 2.
Over time, gender schemas develop along with other developments in thinking. For example, early schemas focus on the child’s own gender only, but by around age 8 children develop schemas for the opposite gender as well. Later, by the time the child is a teenager, they realise that a lot of the so-called rules about boys and girls are just social customs and so their gender schema become more flexible."
"245","Psychodynamic explanations of gender development, like psychodynamic approaches to psychology in general, focus on unconscious conflicts between different aspects of the mind. The main example of this is Freud’s psychoanalytic theory.
Freud’s psychoanalytic theory explains behaviour as the result of conflicts between different parts of the mind: The id, the ego, and the superego (see the approaches page for more details).
Resolution of the Oedipus complex (named after the mythical Greek king who accidentally killed his father and married his mother) is Freud’s explanation of male gender development."
"246","Prior to the phallic psychosexual stage (3-5 years), a boy has no concept of his gender. Then, during the phallic stage, the boy develops an unconscious sexual desire for his mother. This desire leads to unconscious feelings of jealousy and hatred towards his father, because the father has what the boy desires (the mother). The boy’s id – the unconscious and instinctive part of the mind that is only concerned with pleasure – wants to kill the father in order to have the mother for himself."
"247","But the boy’s ego – the practical part of the mind that mediates between the desires of the id and reality – recognises that the father is stronger than him. This leads to fear of the father. The boy thinks that, if his father discovers that he desires his mother for himself, the father will remove his penis (castration anxiety).
To resolve these conflicting desires and beliefs, the boy abandons the desire for his mother and identifies with the father. By identifying with the father, the boy incorporates and internalises the father’s personality into his superego. Internalising the father’s personality means also internalising the father’s masculine gender. The boy develops his gender by displacing the sexual desire for his mother onto other women."
"248","Resolution of the Electra complex (named (by Carl Jung, not Freud) after the mythical Greek daughter of King Agamemnon who killed her mother) is Freud’s explanation of female gender development."
"249","Prior to the phallic psychosexual stage (3-5 years), a girl has no concept of her gender. After she reaches this stage, the girl believes that the reason she does not have a penis is because she has been castrated. The girl desires a penis (penis envy) and so develops a desire for her father as he has what she wants. The girl also develops a dislike of her mother for two reasons: Firstly, because she blames the mother for taking her penis, and secondly, because she sees the mother as competition for her father’s love. However, the girl also loves her mother and fears losing her love if she discovers her desires for her father."
"250","To resolve these conflicting desires, the girl represses her feelings of dislike for her mother and instead identifies with her. By identifying with the mother, the girl incorporates and internalises the mother’s personality into her superego. Internalising the mother’s personality means also internalising the mother’s feminine gender. The girl develops her gender by substituting her desire for a penis with a desire to have a baby."
"251","Social learning theory (see the approaches page for more details) explains gender as resulting from observation and imitation of gender role models. For example, a boy may observe and imitate his father’s behaviour. Gender-typical behaviours may then be reinforced. For example, a boy may be praised for gender-typical behaviour (e.g. “wow, you’re so strong!”) or punished for opposite-gender behaviour (e.g. “stop acting like a girl!”).
Role models can include things like parents, siblings, and peers but the syllabus focuses on gender role models in culture and the media specifically."
"252","Bandura and Bussey (1999) give several examples of how gender roles are portrayed in the media. For example, TV shows typically portray men as ambitious and having high-status jobs whereas women are typically portrayed as unambitious and occupying domestic roles or low-status jobs. Men are also portrayed as having greater agency (i.e. control over events), whereas women are more likely to be at the mercy of others. These stereotypes also exist in adverts, with women typically promoting food and beauty products and men promoting things like computers, cars, and financial products."
"253","There is evidence that these stereotypes influence gender roles. For example, McGhee and Frueh (1980) found a correlation between media exposure and stereotypical views of sex-roles. In other words, the more TV a child watches, the more likely they are to have stereotypical views about gender.
These studies support the social learning theory explanation of gender development: Children observe role models in the media, identify with those of the same gender, and imitate their gender-typical behaviour."
"254","Comparing gender roles among different cultures can provide insights into how much gender is a social construct and how much it is a biological one: If gender roles are biological, you would expect different cultures to have the same gender stereotypes because human biology is basically the same across cultures. But if gender roles are socially constructed, you would expect greater variation between cultures because different cultures would create different social norms and values.
These differences between cultures suggest that gender roles are culturally, rather than biologically, determined."
"255","However, Mead’s interpretations have been criticised. For example, Errington and Gewertz (1989) also studied the Tchambuli (Chambri) tribe but found no evidence to support the gender roles described by Mead. Further, several studies (see AO3 evaluation points below) have found gender roles are generally consistent across different cultures.
Gender dysphoria (previously referred to as gender identity disorder) is a condition where a person’s biological sex does not match their psychological gender. For example, somebody born biologically male (i.e. with XY chromosomes) may be psychologically female."
"256","Gender dysphoria often begins in childhood. It can cause symptoms such as anxiety and depression as the person feels uncomfortable in a body that is the ‘wrong’ sex. To help reduce these feelings of discomfort, the person may take steps to make their outer appearance align with their inner gender. For example, a male-to-female transgender person may wear gender-typical female clothes, take feminising hormones (estrogen), and undergo gender reassignment surgery.
The syllabus looks at biological and social explanations of gender dysphoria.
Biological explanations of gender dysphoria include genetics, hormones, and brain structures. These different biological factors interact with one another and so cannot easily be separated. For example, a person’s genetics influence their brain structure."
"257","As always, twin studies are a useful way to determine the extent to which a condition is caused by genetic factors. If gender dysphoria is more common among both identical twins (who share 100% of their genes) than both non-identical twins (who only share 50% of their genes), this would suggest genetics play a role."
"258","In general, twin studies support a genetic basis of gender dysphoria. This genetic basis is further supported by gene association studies. For example, Hare et al (2009) analysed gene samples from 112 male-to-female transgender people and 258 controls, finding that gender dysphoria is correlated with differences in AR (androgen receptor) genes. In a gene association study of female-to-male transgender people, Bentz et al (2008) found gender dysphoria was correlated with the CYP17 gene. These studies suggest gender dysphoria is caused by different genes depending on whether the person is born biologically male or female."
"259","Prenatal hormones affect brain development (see above for examples), which may explain the mechanism through which hormones cause gender dysphoria. However, the role of prenatal hormones in gender dysphoria is disputed (see AO3 evaluation points below).
Another area of the brain associated with gender identity is the interstitial nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus (INAH3). Males typically have twice as many neurons in this region as females, but post-mortems by Garcia-Falgueras and Swaab (2008) found MtFs had neuron numbers similar to female controls and FtMs had neuron numbers similar to male controls."
"260","Social explanations of gender dysphoria explain gender dysphoria as learned from the environment. This includes behaviourist explanations, such as operant conditioning, as well as social learning theory."
"261","Social learning theory would say that gender dysphoria is caused by children observing and imitating role models of the opposite sex. For example, a young boy might observe his mother receiving compliments on her dress (vicarious reinforcement) and imitate this behaviour. This cross-gender behaviour may also be reinforced via operant conditioning. For example, adults may encourage or praise the boy for wearing a dress. This creates a conflict between the boy’s biological sex and psychological gender, leading to gender dysphoria. Piaget’s theory says humans are born with innate (biological) abilities and that cognitive development occurs through a combination of these abilities and environmental interactions (in particular interactions with physical objects)."
"262","If you remember from the approaches topic, schema are cognitive frameworks/mental models/ways of organising information and understanding the world. Piaget’s theory explains children’s cognitive development in terms of continually challenging and updating these schema through interacting with the environment.
Initially, children are born with very basic schema (e.g. the basic reflex to suck things). These basic schema serve as a foundation from which the child can interact with the environment and learn new things. Over time, the child will develop new schema (e.g. about people, objects, and themselves) and update their existing schema. This process of developing schema process continues all through a person’s life but is most notable within the first 15 years."
"263","Children swing between equilibrium and disequilibrium in a process known as equilibration. When a new experience fits within existing schema, it can be assimilated and equilibrium is maintained. If a new experience does not fit within existing schema, this causes a state of disequilibrium and the current schema must be updated to accommodate the new experience.
Equilibrium is when an experience fits within the child’s existing schema (i.e. the experience is in line with the child’s expectations). This is a pleasant and desirable state because it means the child understands the world around them.
When a new experience fits with existing schema, it is assimilated into that schema."
"264","When a new experience fits with existing schema, it is assimilated into that schema.
For example, a child might develop the gender schema that women have long hair. If the child meets a new woman and she has long hair, the child can include/assimilate this new person within their existing schema of ‘woman’.
Disequilibrium is when an experience does not fit within the child’s existing schema. This is an unpleasant state because it means the child does not understand what is going on, causing confusion. This unpleasant feeling creates a motivation to learn and return to the pleasant state of equilibrium."
"265","When a new experience does not fit within existing schema, it cannot be assimilated into that schema. Instead, the child must create new schema or update their existing schema in order to accommodate the new experience. Once the schema is updated to accommodate the new experience, the child returns to a state of equilibrium.
For example, if a child has developed the gender schema that women have long hair but then meets a woman with short hair, this causes disequilibrium. The child can accommodate this new experience and return to equilibrium by updating their schema of ‘woman’ to include people with short hair."
"266","Piaget observed that children of similar ages would give similar wrong answers to certain questions. Piaget also observed that children would learn to give the right answers at similar ages too, suggesting intellectual development occurs in a series of stages. These stages were observed cross culturally, suggesting intellectual development is primarily controlled by genetics and biology rather than culture.
The sensorimotor stage of intellectual development occurs from birth to age 2 and is primarily concerned with the physical world and body movement."
"267","During this stage, babies develop object permanence (an understanding that objects still exist even when they are out of view). This is illustrated by the observation that before ~8 months of age babies switch focus from an object as soon as they can no longer see it. But from around 8 months, babies will look for an object when they can no longer see it, suggesting they understand that it continues to exist.
Other intellectual developments in the sensorimotor stage include basic language and, from around 18 months, representational thought (i.e. being able to think about objects in their heads as opposed to only being able to think about things that are physically in front of them)."
"268","The pre-operational stage of intellectual development occurs between 2 years – 7 years of age. Within the pre-operational stage, Piaget distinguishes between pre-conceptual (2 – 4 years) and intuitive (4 – 7 years)."
"269","In the pre-operational stage, thinking is still characterised by egocentrism (the child can only see things from their own perspective and can’t understand the perspective of other people). For example, Piaget and Inhelder’s (1956) 3 mountains task let children examine a model of a Swiss mountain on a table. A doll was placed on top of one of the model mountains and the children were asked to select pictures of what the doll could see. However, the 4 year olds would consistently select the pictures of what they saw (not the doll), which suggests the children were unable to visualise things from another person’s perspective."
"270","During the pre-operational stage, the child has not mastered conservation (the understanding that changing the appearance of an object does not change its mass or quantity or volume). For example, Piaget (1952) conducted an experiment where 7 year olds were shown two equal beakers of water: A and B. The children could see that A and B contained the same amount of water. But when the water from B was poured into a taller, thinner, beaker (C), the children thought beaker C contained more water."
"271","Children in the pre-operational stage have not developed class inclusion (the understanding that things can be sub-sets of other things) either. For example, Piaget and Inhelder (1956) showed children a picture with 5 dogs and 2 cats and then asked: “Are there more dogs or more animals?”. The children would answer that there are more dogs, because they are unable to comprehend that each dog was a member of the dog class and the animal class.
The concrete operational stage occurs between 7 years – 11 years of age. Operations, here, are the use of schema to perform mental actions, such as logical reasoning."
"272","Conservation is an example of an operation. In the concrete operations stage, children understand conservation and so are able to correctly identify that, for example, beaker C in Piaget’s example above contains as much water as beaker A despite its different appearance.
The child also learns class inclusion in the concrete operational stage. For example, the child can understand that a dog is a mammal, and that a mammal is an animal. Returning to Piaget and Inhelder’s example above, a child in the concrete operational stage could correctly answer that there are more animals than dogs when shown a picture with 5 dogs and 2 cats."
"273","Egocentrism also declines during the concrete operational stage in a process called decentering. The child learns to be able to imagine things from the perspective of someone else other than themself. So, in the 3 mountains task above, children in the concrete operational stage are able to select photos from the doll’s perspective and not just their own.
However, in the concrete operational stage, these operations can only be performed on objects directly in front of the child (and not abstractly), which is why this stage is concrete operational. Abstract reasoning develops in the formal operational stage."
"274","The formal operational stage occurs from 11 years of age onwards. As mentioned, operations are the use of schema to perform mental actions. But whereas these operations were restricted to concrete examples in the concrete operational stage, children in the formal operational stage are able to reason abstractly and hypothetically.
By contrast, children in the earlier concrete operational stage get hung up on specific (concrete) facts, like how dogs don’t have 10 legs and can’t fly."
"275","Like Piaget, Vygotsky’s theory describes how interactions with the environment explain cognitive development. But where Piaget emphasised interactions with physical objects, Vygotsky emphasises social and cultural factors (e.g. interaction with parents, teachers, and other children). For Vygotsky, learning is first intermental (between two people) and then made intramental (internalised within the individual).
Vygotsky’s theory is concerned with how these higher mental functions develop through social interactions.
There is some overlap with Piaget’s stages of development here. For example, Vygotsky’s mature concept stage is somewhat similar to Piaget’s formal operational stage."
"276","The zone of proximal development is the gap between an infant’s current intellectual ability and their potential intellectual ability."
"277","For example, a 3 year-old child may currently be able to write a few individual words but be unable to write a sentence. However, the 3 year-old child has the potential to be able to write a sentence with help from a teacher (e.g. a parent or older sibling) and so writing a sentence is within the child’s zone of proximal development. The teacher’s job is to guide the child through the zone of proximal development so that they can complete this task alone.
One way a teacher can help a child progress through the zone of proximal development is via scaffolding."
"278","Scaffolding is when a teacher (e.g. a parent or older sibling) helps an infant to learn by providing a framework – a scaffold – to help them solve a problem or complete a task. As the infant progresses, the scaffolding is gradually removed until the infant is capable of completing the task by itself.
For example, a parent may physically guide a young child’s hand to show them how to write their name. Then, as the child attempts to write their name without the physical guidance, the parent may watch and provide verbal instructions to help. Eventually, this scaffolding is removed as well and the infant is able to write their name by itself."
"279","Baillargeon challenges Piaget’s claim that babies develop object permanence (the idea that objects still exist even when you’re not looking at them) at around 8 months old. Instead, Baillargeon argues that babies have a physical reasoning system that is present from birth.
Piaget’s evidence that babies only develop object permanence at 8 months is that before 8 months of age babies stop focusing on an object as soon as it is out of view but after 8 months babies will look for an object when they can no longer see it. However, Bailargeon argues that the only reason babies don’t look for objects prior to 8 months of age is that they lack the motor abilities to do so – not because they lack object permanence."
"280","Baillargeon argues that humans are born with core knowledge/an innate physical reasoning system from birth. Just as horses have an innate ability to walk immediately after being born, for example, humans have an innate ability to understand the physical world. Baillargeon’s violation of expectation studies support this claim.
Baillargeon and colleagues have conducted several studies using the violation of expectation procedure to demonstrate that infants under 8 months of age possess knowledge of the physical world."
"281","The idea is that infants will look at things that don’t fit with their understanding of the physical world (i.e. things that violate their expectations) for longer than they will look at things that do fit with their understanding of the physical world (i.e. that are in line with their expectations)."
"282","You would expect to see the tall rabbit’s head and ears over the top of the wall but scenario 2 (the impossible event) violates expectations.
Baillargeon and Graber observed that, on average, infants looked at the impossible event for much longer than they looked at the possible event (33.07 seconds vs. 25.11 seconds).
This suggests that the infants (all less than 6 months old) expected the tall rabbit to appear in the gap in the wall and were surprised when it didn’t, which suggests they had an understanding of object permanence. This contradicts Piaget’s claim that infants do not understand object permanence before 8 months of age."
"283","Social cognition is a person’s understanding of themself as an individual in the context of society and other people (e.g. the competing demands of what you want and what other people and society in general may want).
Perspective-taking is the ability to put yourself in another person’s shoes and see things from their point of view. As infants grow, they learn to see things from different perspectives.
Theory of mind is not a psychological theory like, for example, Piaget’s or Vygotsky’s. Instead, it refers to our ability to imagine and model the mental states of other people’s minds."
"284","For example, if you hear that your friend lost their job, you can imagine that your friend might be feeling upset or sad or angry. Even though you can’t literally see into their mind, your theory of mind enables you to understand their mental state. This theory of mind also enables you to explain and predict their behaviour.
The Sally-Anne test is a way to test a person’s theory of mind (in this case the understanding that other people can have false beliefs). The Sally-Anne test and similar studies suggest children develop theory of mind at around 3 – 4 years old. However, children with autism have difficulties developing theory of mind.
The Sally-Anne test is a way to test a person’s theory of mind."
"285","The Sally-Anne test is a way to test a person’s theory of mind.
The correct answer is that Sally will look in her basket for the marble. This is because Sally won’t have seen Anne move the marble into her box and so will have the false belief that it is still in her basket. It requires theory of mind to put yourself in Anne’s position and understand that she will have a false belief based on the information available to her."
"286","Autism is a developmental disorder characterised by difficulties with social cognition, such as difficulties interacting and communicating with other people. The findings of this study suggest these difficulties are caused – at least in part – by problems with theory of mind. People with autism may be unable to understand the minds of other people, such as what Sally will be thinking in the Sally-Anne test. This lack of theory of mind is sometimes called mind-blindness.
When you perform an action, neurons in the brain activate – no surprise. But also, those same neurons may activate when you observe someone else performing that action. These are mirror neurons: Neurons that activate both when you perform an action and when you observe someone else perform that action."
"287","For example, Rizzolatti et al (1996) observed that, in monkeys, the same areas of the brain activated when the monkeys reached for food as when they watched someone else reach for food. This is one of the earliest studies demonstrating the existence of mirror neurons.
Mirror neurons may be the biological basis of social cognition, enabling us to empathise with others, which would help inform our theory of mind and perspective-taking."
"288","Given that mirror neurons are associated with social cognition, and autism is associated with difficulties in social cognition, Ramachandran and Oberman (2006) propose the ‘broken mirror’ theory of autism. The broken mirror theory says autism is caused in part by deficiencies in the mirror neuron system. Schizophrenia is a psychological condition characterised by a loss of contact with reality. It affects around 0.7% of the population. There is no single defining symptom of schizophrenia but a cluster of (often seemingly unrelated) symptoms. These symptoms may be positive (experiences in addition to ordinary experience, such as hallucinations) or negative (a lack of abilities associated with normal experience, such as reductions in speech)."
"289","Positive symptoms are additional experiences beyond those associated with normal psychological functioning. Positive symptoms associated with schizophrenia include hallucinations and delusions.
Hallucinations are perceptions that are not based in reality, or distorted perceptions of reality.
For example, a schizophrenic person may hallucinate hearing voices that aren’t really there, or seeing someone who isn’t really there.
Delusions are beliefs that are not based in reality.
For example, a schizophrenic person may have a delusion that they are the victim of a grand conspiracy, or that they are an important person with a unique mission (e.g. Jesus Christ reborn)."
"290","Negative symptoms are a lack of abilities associated with normal psychological functioning. Negative symptoms associated with schizophrenia include speech poverty and avolition.
Speech poverty is a reduction in the quality and amount of speech.
For example, a schizophrenic person may give one-word answers to questions without elaborating any further detail.
Avolition is a lack of desire and motivation for anything.
For example, a schizophrenic person may sit around without engaging in everyday tasks such as work, socialising, or maintaining personal hygiene."
"291","There are two main classification systems for diagnosing schizophrenia: The American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) and the World Health Organisation’s International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10). These manuals enable doctors to label a patient’s symptoms as those of schizophrenia (rather than some other disorder).
The criteria for DSM-5 and ICD-10 differ slightly: DSM-5 requires at least one positive symptom to be present, whereas diagnosis of schizophrenia using ICD-10 can be based on negative symptoms alone."
"292","Reliability refers to how consistently schizophrenia is diagnosed. For example, if multiple different doctors diagnose the same person as schizophrenic based on the same symptoms, then their diagnosis is reliable.
Validity refers to how accurately schizophrenia is diagnosed. For example, if doctors frequently diagnose patients with autism as suffering from schizophrenia, then their diagnosis is not valid."
"293","Rosenhan (1973) questions the validity of schizophrenia diagnosis. In this study, eight healthy volunteers (i.e. subjects who did not have schizophrenia) presented themselves to various psychiatric hospitals claiming to hear voices. All eight volunteers were successfully admitted to the hospitals and diagnosed with schizophrenia. Depending on the ‘patient’, doctors took between 7-52 days to release them. In a later experiment, doctors were falsely told that healthy patients would attempt to admit themselves, which led doctors to turn genuine schizophrenic patients away because they thought they were actors. The results of these experiments suggest the doctors did not have valid methods for diagnosing schizophrenia."
"294","Biological explanations of schizophrenia look at biological factors linked to schizophrenia. These include genetics, neural (brain) abnormalities, and abnormalities in dopamine.
The genetic explanation of schizophrenia looks at hereditary factors – i.e. genes – that contribute to the development of schizophrenia."
"295","As always, twin studies are a useful way to determine whether or not a condition is inherited through genetics. If it is more common for both identical twins to suffer from schizophrenia than it is for both non-identical twins, this would suggest a genetic component to schizophrenia. The reason for this is that identical twins have 100% identical genetics whereas non-identical twins only share 50% of their genes and so any genetic condition would be equally common to both identical twins."
"296","Gottesman found that the closer the genetic relationship to the person with schizophrenia, the greater the risk of developing schizophrenia. For example, the concordance rate for schizophrenia among identical twins is 48%, whereas for non-identical twins it is 17%. This supports the idea that genetics play a role in developing schizophrenia.
The neural explanation of schizophrenia looks at correlations among the brain structures of people with schizophrenia.
There are several ways to examine the brain, such as post-mortem and fMRI scanning. By using these methods, researchers can compare the brains of schizophrenic people with non-schizophrenic people to identify differences in brain structures that may cause schizophrenia."
"297","For example, the images above from Kim et al (2010) show fMRI scans of a schizophrenic patient and a non-schizophrenic control during a working memory task.
The dopamine hypothesis explains schizophrenia (at least partly) as a result of abnormal activity of the neurotransmitter dopamine.
The dopamine hypothesis became popular in the 1970s when studies (e.g. Seeman et al (1976), Creese et al (1976), and Snyder (1976)) reported that several drugs that reduce schizophrenia symptoms are dopamine receptor antagonists: They reduce dopamine activity. The implication is that schizophrenia is caused by increased dopamine activity and that these drugs work by reducing dopamine activity."
"298","Over the years, the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia has been refined. It’s not as simple as high dopamine = schizophrenia. Instead, research suggests that schizophrenia is linked with high dopamine activity in some areas of the brain (e.g. the subcortex) but low dopamine activity in other areas (e.g. prefrontal cortex).
The dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia remains somewhat controversial. The AO3 evaluation points below provide examples of evidence against the dopamine hypothesis.
Antipsychotic drugs are the primary biological treatment for schizophrenia. These drugs are divided into two categories: Typical antipsychotics and atypical antipsychotics."
"299","Typical antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia work by reducing dopamine activity – they are dopamine antagonists – and are thus strongly associated with the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia. They have been used since the 1950’s and are sometimes referred to as first-generation antipsychotics.
Chlorpromazine was the first antipsychotic drug developed. It is a dopamine antagonist, which means it works by blocking dopamine receptors in the brain. Chlorpromazine also has sedative effects.
Typical antipsychotic drugs, such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol, can cause several side effects. Among the most serious of these side effects are extrapyramidal symptoms, which are problems with movement similar to Parkinson’s disease."
"300","Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been around since the 1970’s and are sometimes referred to as second-generation antipsychotics. The aim of these drugs is to improve upon the efficacy of typical antipsychotics while reducing side effects.
Atypical antipsychotics target several neurotransmitters, not just dopamine. For example, clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic that acts on the neurotransmitters dopamine, serotonin, and glutamate. Risperidone, another atypical antipsychotic, targets dopamine and serotonin."
"301","Some evidence suggests atypical antipsychotics are superior to typical antipsychotics (see AO3 evaluation points below). However, atypical antipsychotics also carry a risk of side effects including weight gain, increased risk of heart attack, increased risk of diabetes, and extrapyramidal symptoms.
In general, there is no one-size-fits-all drug therapy for schizophrenia. The different mechanisms of action and side effect profiles of the various drugs (both typical and atypical) mean the best treatment option will vary from patient to patient. Further, drug therapy can be combined with psychological treatments such as CBT.
Psychological explanations of schizophrenia include family dysfunction and cognitive explanations (e.g. dysfunctional thought processing)."
"302","Several psychologists have proposed that family dysfunction (e.g. high levels of conflict or difficulties communicating) can influence the development of schizophrenia."
"303","One example of this is Bateson et al (1956), who proposed the double bind explanation of schizophrenia. According to this explanation, children who often get conflicting messages from their parents are more likely to develop schizophrenia. For example, a mother who loves her child but has trouble expressing it may exhibit contradictory behaviours (e.g. hugging the child but being critical with her words). Another example is a parent who tells their child to be more spontaneous: Whatever the child does, they can’t fulfil this request because if they do act more spontaneous because their parent tells them then they aren’t acting spontaneously! Constant exposure to these mixed messages and impossible demands mean the child is unable to form a coherent picture of reality. This leads to"
"304","impossible demands mean the child is unable to form a coherent picture of reality. This leads to disorganised thinking which in extreme cases can manifest as symptoms of schizophrenia such as delusions and hallucinations."
"305","Another familial explanation of schizophrenia is expressed emotion. An environment with a high degree of expressed emotion – particularly negative, such as criticism and hostility – causes stress, which increases the risk of schizophrenia. Expressed emotion is primarily associated with relapse in schizophrenic patients.
In addition to antipsychotic drugs, various psychological treatments for schizophrenia exist such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), family therapy, and the use of token economies.
Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is the main psychological treatment for schizophrenia. There are many different forms of CBT, but the main aim is to help patients identify and challenge the irrational and maladaptive thoughts underlying schizophrenia."
"306","For example, a schizophrenic patient may have delusional thoughts that there is a conspiracy to kill them. These thoughts cause negative emotions (e.g. fear, anxiety) and irrational behaviours (e.g. hiding from or attacking people).
CBT involves talking through irrational thoughts like this. The patient is encouraged to describe their thoughts to the therapist. The therapist then helps the patient identify and challenge the reality of these thoughts. For example, the therapist may ask the patient to consider how likely these thoughts are to be true and consider alternative explanations. The therapist may also help the patient tackle their symptoms from the behavioural angle (e.g. by teaching behavioural coping skills) and the emotional angle (e.g. by teaching relaxation techniques)."
"307","CBT is primarily used to treat positive symptoms of schizophrenia and is commonly used in combination with antipsychotic drug therapy. A typical course of CBT for schizophrenia might consist of 12 sessions spaced 10 days apart."
"308","Evidence supporting efficacy of CBT: Several studies have shown that CBT effectively reduces schizophrenia symptoms. For example, a meta-analysis of 14 studies involving 1,484 schizophrenia patients by Zimmermann et al (2005) found CBT significantly reduced positive symptoms of the disorder.
Complements other treatments: CBT can be used in conjunction with other treatments, such as antipsychotic drugs. Some evidence suggests this combined therapy is more effective than antipsychotic drugs or CBT alone.
Less side effects than antipsychotic drugs: CBT has very few side effects. By comparison, antipsychotic drugs carry a risk of serious and potentially fatal side effects such as pyramidal symptoms, increased risk of heart attack, and weight gain."
"309","Conflicting evidence: Contrary to Zimmerman et al (2005), a meta-analysis by Jauhar et al (2014) found CBT only had minor effects on schizophrenia symptoms. Further, when the researchers looked at blinded studies only (i.e. studies where the researchers were not aware which patients received CBT and which didn’t), even this small effect size disappeared. This calls into question the efficacy of CBT and suggests that research supporting the efficacy of CBT for schizophrenia may simply be the result of researcher bias.
Not suitable for all patients: An important aspect of CBT is developing a trusting alliance between patient and therapist. However, some schizophrenic patients may be too paranoid or anxious to develop such a trusting alliance and so are not suitable candidates for CBT."
"310","A typical course of family therapy may consist of weekly sessions for a year, after which the family members will have developed skills that they can use after therapy has ended.
Token economies is a behaviourist approach to schizophrenia based on operant conditioning: Schizophrenic patients are awarded tokens (that can be exchanged for rewards) in return for desirable behaviour.
Token economies are mainly used to treat negative symptoms of schizophrenia, such as avolition. For example, avolition may mean the patient has little motivation to undertake tasks such as getting out of bed, washing, and socialising. Token economies provide an incentive for the patient to undertake these tasks, changing their behaviour."
"311","Token economies are primarily used for schizophrenic patients who are in institutions for long time periods. As well as schizophrenia, token economies are also used to deal with criminal behaviour (see the forensic psychology page for more details).
Rather than trying to reduce schizophrenia to either a psychological or biological phenomena, interactionist approaches to schizophrenia explain the disorder as a combination of various factors. One example of this is the diathesis-stress model."
"312","The diathesis-stress model of schizophrenia explains the disorder as a combination of genetic and environmental factors. According to this model, biology determines a person’s vulnerability to schizophrenia (biological diathesis), but schizophrenia is only triggered in response to environmental stressors (stress).
So, a person with a high genetic predisposition towards schizophrenia may never develop the disorder (e.g. if they live in a supportive low-stress environment) but a person with a lower genetic disposition may develop schizophrenia if exposed to enough environmental stress (e.g. dysfunctional family upbringing, drug abuse, etc.). In other words, genetic disposition is necessary to developing schizophrenia, but not sufficient by itself."
"313","The diathesis-stress model originated with Meehl (1962), who proposed the existence of a single ‘schizogene’ – the effects of which are activated in response to stress. However, more recent research (e.g. Ripke et al (2014)) suggests multiple genes contribute to genetic risk for schizophrenia. Also, ‘stress’ in the diathesis-stress model is not just the emotion – it includes anything that increases the risk of triggering schizophrenia (e.g. drug use, illness, physical trauma, sexual abuse).
Interactionist treatment approaches to schizophrenia tackle the disorder from multiple angles."
"314","Interactionist treatment approaches to schizophrenia tackle the disorder from multiple angles.
For example, a patient may be given antipsychotic drug therapy (a biological approach to treatment) in combination with cognitive behavioural therapy (a psychological approach to treatment). In general, research suggests such interactionist approaches are more effective than either treatment in isolation."
"315","Although interactionist treatment approaches seem to be most effective, there is no one-size-fits-all solution. For example, family therapy will be more beneficial to a schizophrenic patient who was raised in a dysfunctional family environment, and the most suitable antipsychotic drug therapy for each patient will vary depending on efficacy and side effects. Costs are another factor to consider: It might not be economically viable to provide all schizophrenic patients with every possible treatment option. Evolution is the process by which species adapt to their environment. Over many many years, random mutations in genes that are advantageous to the animal become more widespread among the species."
"316","In the case of food, evolution would mean genes that help humans identify and eat healthy, safe, and nutritious food will become more common. If you had genes that resulted in a preference for nutritious and commonly-found foods, for example, you would be less likely to starve and more likely to remain healthy and pass on those genes. In contrast, if you had genes that meant you really liked the taste of deadly mushrooms, you probably wouldn’t live long enough to reproduce and pass on those genes."
"317","Evolution can explain human preferences for different foods. For example, sweet foods are often high in energy, which can also be stored as fat to reduce the chance of starvation. In contrast, poisons often have a bitter taste, which may explain why humans generally prefer sweet foods to bitter ones – it’s genetic.
Neophobia is an innate dislike of foods we haven’t tried before. This makes sense from an evolutionary perspective as unfamiliar foods could potentially be poisonous or unhealthy. You’re more likely to survive if you stick with familiar foods as you already know they’re safe.
We overcome neophobia via learning. In a study of young children, Birch et al (1987) found that preference for new foods increased over time with repeated exposure to those foods."
"318","Taste aversion is when a person develops a dislike for a certain food after becoming ill from it. For example, you eat yoghurt, get food poisoning, and from then on even the thought of eating yoghurt again makes you feel sick."
"319","Although kind of like classical conditioning, taste aversion doesn’t work in quite the same way because the time between eating the food and getting ill is often quite long. Instead, the more accurate description is biological preparedness (Seligman (1971)), which is the idea that humans are biologically hard-wired to learn certain kinds of associations very easily. This would make sense from an evolutionary perspective: If certain foods are dangerous, it would be advantageous to learn this as quickly as possible because the next time you eat that food you might get ill again or die.
In addition to genetic/evolutionary factors, humans also learn food preferences from social influences and their culture.
There are several ways social influences affect food preferences."
"320","There are several ways social influences affect food preferences.
Firstly, what a child’s mother eats during development affects the child’s food preferences. In the womb, foods (and flavours) the mother eats are fed to the baby via the amniotic fluid. After birth, foods and flavours are transmitted from the mother to the baby via breast milk. This contributes towards a preference for the same foods as the mother.
Secondly, social learning affects food preferences. Children observe what parents and other role models eat, which they then imitate. This helps reduce neophobia, encouraging the child to eat a wider range of foods."
"321","Thirdly, operant conditioning also contributes to food preferences. If you enjoy eating a certain food, then that enjoyment serves as positive reinforcement, which increases the chances of you eating it again. However, research suggests that operant conditioning doesn’t really work to create food preferences. For example, if parents try to teach their children to like certain foods (e.g. vegetables) through rewards (e.g. praise for eating vegetables), it may actually decrease preference for those foods."
"322","Different cultures have different eating behaviours and these cultural influences affect food preferences. For example, some religious cultures (e.g. Islam and Judaism) forbid eating pork, whereas others forbid eating beef (e.g. Hinduism). Different cultures also have different local cuisines (e.g. eating snails in France (escargots), raw octopus in Korea (san-nakji)), which affect food preferences.
Neural and hormonal mechanisms control eating behaviour biologically, making you feel hungry or full. The main neural mechanism is activity in the hypothalamus region of the brain, and the main hormones responsible for hunger and satiety are ghrelin and leptin."
"323","The hypothalamus is the main section of the brain responsible for maintaining homeostasis (i.e. stability and normal functioning) within the body. It controls things like body temperature, sleep, and hunger.
The process is as follows: When blood sugar (glucose) is low, the liver sends signals to the lateral hypothalamus. This causes neurons to fire that make you feel hungry and start eating. Then, when you eat, glucose is released into the blood, which is detected by the ventromedial hypothalamus. This causes neurons to fire that make you feel satiated (full)."
"324","Ghrelin is a hormone that makes you feel hungry. It is secreted by the stomach into the bloodstream, which is detected by the hypothalamus, creating the sensation of hunger. When you eat food, the stomach stops releasing ghrelin, which stops you feeling hungry. After the meal is eaten, ghrelin levels (and hunger) progressively increase until the next time you eat.
Leptin is a hormone that makes you feel full. It is secreted by fat cells into the bloodstream, which signals to the hypothalamus that energy storage (fat deposits) is high and so you don’t need to eat. If you don’t eat for a while, the body uses these fat deposits for energy, and so those fat cells no longer exist to produce leptin. This reduction in leptin makes you feel hungry."
"325","Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterised by an obsession with losing weight, body image distortion, restriction of food consumption, and low bodyweight. Estimates vary, but anorexia affects roughly 1% of the population, of which 85% are female.
The syllabus looks at biological and psychological explanations of anorexia.
Biological explanations of anorexia look at the role of genetics and neural factors (such as brain structures and neurotransmitter activity).
The genetic explanation of anorexia looks at hereditary factors – i.e. genes inherited from parents – that contribute to the development of anorexia."
"326","Despite variations in estimates, the fact that identical twins are more likely to both suffer from anorexia than non-identical twins suggests there is a genetic component to the disorder.
The role of genetics is further supported by gene association studies (e.g. Wang et al (2011) and Scott-Van Zeeland et al (2014)), which compare DNA profiles of anorexia sufferers with non-anorexic controls. These studies have found various genes to be correlated with anorexia, such as OPRD1, HTR1D, and EPHX2.
Neural explanations of anorexia look at differences in the brain structures and neurochemistry of people with anorexia."
"327","Some research suggests that people with anorexia have reduced blood flow in the lateral hypothalamus (the part of the brain associated with hunger), but it is unclear whether this is a cause or an effect of anorexia. More recently, researchers (e.g. Nunn et al (2011)) have proposed that damage to the insula cortex of the brain is a key cause of anorexia."
"328","In addition to physical brain structures, neural explanations of anorexia also focus on the role of neurotransmitters. For example, several studies have found correlations between serotonin activity and anorexia, although the exact relationship is unclear. One hypothesis proposed by Kaye et al (2009) is that anorexic patients naturally have elevated serotonin activity, which causes them anxiety. Starvation reduces serotonin levels (food is needed to produce serotonin), which reduces this anxiety and reinforces anorexic behaviour. Research (e.g. Bailer et al (2013)) also suggests over-production of the neurotransmitter dopamine may contribute to anorexia."
"329","There are several psychological explanations of anorexia, including family systems theory, social learning theory, and cognitive explanations.
This dysfunctional family style can contribute to anorexia in various ways. For example, becoming anorexic may be a way to reduce conflict by distracting the family members from other problems. For example, a child who fears their parents will split up due to constant arguing may become anorexic in order to shift the parents’ attention away from those arguments, keeping the family together."
"330","A related explanation (e.g. Bruch (1978)) is that anorexia is a way for people to assert autonomy and control. For example, refusing to eat might be a way for a family member to assert their individuality and free will against their overprotective and enmeshed family.
Social learning theory (see the approaches page for more details) explains anorexia as learned behaviour from observation and imitation of role models."
"331","The syllabus mentions social learning theory specifically, but other learning approaches (operant conditioning) may also reinforce anorexic behaviour. For example, when the anorexic patient starts imitating the behaviour themself, they may receive compliments for being slim (positive reinforcement) or people may stop criticising them for being overweight (negative reinforcement).
The media plays an important part in social learning explanations of anorexia. For example, singers, actresses, and models in magazines and social media are often depicted as slim, and slimness is depicted as desirable – especially in Western cultures. The praise these role models receive in the media provides further vicarious reinforcement of losing weight, which may lead to anorexia."
"332","Obesity is a physical condition characterised by excess body fat, which may cause other health problems such as heart disease and diabetes. It is a leading cause of preventable death in many countries, including the UK. In the UK, around 30% of the population is classified as obese.
The syllabus looks at biological and psychological explanations of obesity.
Biological explanations of obesity look at the role of genetics and neural factors (such as brain structures and neurotransmitter activity).
The genetic explanation of obesity looks at hereditary factors – i.e. genes inherited from mother and father – that make someone more or less likely to become obese."
"333","In addition to these family studies, genome association studies compare the genetic profiles of obese individuals with non-obese controls to identify genes that may contribute to obesity. For example, several studies (e.g. Fall and Ingelsson (2012), Frayling et al (2007), and Hinney et al (2007)) have found the FTO gene to be correlated with obesity. However, there is no single obesity gene – many genes appear to combine to increase or decrease a person’s risk for obesity."
"334","Neural explanations of obesity focus on the neural mechanisms that control eating behaviour as well as the role of neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine.
As described above, the hypothalamus plays a key role in eating behaviour. Some neural explanations say that damage to the ventromedial hypothalamus – the area of the brain responsible for making you feel full – can cause obesity. Other explanations look at the role of leptin – the hormone that makes you feel full – saying that obesity can be caused by neurons that don’t respond properly to this hormone."
"335","Neurotransmitters are also implicated in obesity. For example, Wang et al (2001) and Volkow et al (2008) have used brain scans to measure dopamine receptor activity in obese individuals and controls, with both studies finding that obese individuals have reduced dopamine receptor activity. Dopamine is associated with pleasure and reward and so the associated hypothesis is that obese people overeat to get the same pleasure and reward response as a non-obese person would get from eating less food. This is a similar mechanism to other addictions, such as smoking or drugs.
Other studies (e.g. Hodge et al (2012) and Vickers et al (1999)) suggest lower serotonin levels are also correlated with obesity."
"336","There are several psychological explanations of obesity, including the boundary model and restraint theory. This section also looks at psychological explanations of the success and failure of dieting.
Herman and Polivy (1984) proposed the boundary model. According to this model, people have biologically-set boundaries of food intake. If food falls below a certain minimum level, the person feels the aversive (unpleasant) feeling of hunger that motivates them to eat. At the other end, eating too much food exceeds the maximum level, which causes the aversive feeling of being too full. These levels are primarily determined by biology."
"337","The range in the middle is the zone of biological indifference, where a person’s biology is satisfied. And so, within this zone, psychological factors are more important than biological ones in determining whether a person eats. In other words, a person who consumes food within this zone does not do so for biological reasons (i.e. to avoid starvation), but for psychological reasons.
According to restraint theory, trying to eat less can paradoxically make a person eat more and become obese."
"338","A diet is successful if the dieter loses the desired amount of weight and keeps it off for the long-term. There are many factors that contribute to the success or failure of dieting.
In addition to these psychological factors, other factors (e.g. genetics) affect the success or failure of dieting. Stress is the body’s response when an individual feels they are unable to cope with a situation or challenge. This A level psychology topic looks at the following aspects of stress:e"
"339","We have all experienced and know what stress is. But the precise psychological understanding of stress is when an individual feels (rightly or wrongly) that they are not able to cope with the demands of a situation. For example, if you feel like you don’t know enough to pass your psychology A level exam, this will cause you stress.
The fact that this same general sequence was observed irrespective of the specific stressor led Selye to characterise this 3-part stress response as general adaptation syndrome.
The sympathomedullary pathway is associated with acute (short-term) stress.
Note: This is basically the fight or flight response from the biopsychology topic."
"340","Note: This is basically the fight or flight response from the biopsychology topic.
Once the stressor has gone away, the parasympathetic part of the autonomic nervous system reduces bodily activity and switches from fight or flight back to rest and digest.
However, if the stressor remains for an extended time period, the long-term stress response of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system takes over.
The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system is associated with chronic (long-term) stress.
Cortisol is a glucocorticoid hormone that increases blood sugar by converting protein to glucose. This increased blood sugar provides energy to replace the energy lost during the sympathomedullary response and help overcome the stressor."
"341","However, cortisol has negative effects on the body – especially over the long term. For example, excessively high cortisol can cause immunosuppression, which results in increased risk of illness such as cardiovascular (heart) problems.
Prolonged periods of stress can cause physical illness, such as cardiovascular disorders. A key mechanism through which this happens is immunosuppression.
Immunosuppression means a reduction in the ability of the immune system to fight off disease.
The immune system identifies foreign things like bacteria and viruses within the body and destroys them. However, cortisol reduces the production of immune cells (e.g. natural killer cells and T helper cells), which reduces the effectiveness of the immune system."
"342","A study illustrating this is Kiecolt-Glaser et al (1984). In this natural experiment, the researchers took blood samples from 75 medical students a month before their exams and then again on the day of their exams. They found the number of natural killer cells was much lower on the day of their exams (high stress), which demonstrates a correlation between stress and immunosuppression.
In the short term, a bit of cortisol and reduced production of immune cells does not cause major problems (and actually has many benefits). However, prolonged periods of stress are associated with increased risk of diseases such as influenza and cancer. Immunosuppression is a key reason for this: There are fewer immune cells to fight off viruses and clear up cancerous cells."
"343","Cardiovascular disorders are problems of the heart.
Stress is associated with cardiovascular disorders. For example, Yusuf et al (2004) compared lifestyle factors of 15,152 people who’d had a heart attack with a control group of 14,820 who had not had a heart attack. Based on this, the researchers identified strong correlations between stress (e.g. workplace stress and stressful life events) and heart attack.
There are several ways stress can cause cardiovascular disorders. For example, stress causes blood pressure to increase and causes fat to accumulate on arterial walls. There are also more indirect mechanisms. For example, stress may increase the likelihood that a person takes up smoking, which may in turn increase the likelihood of cardiovascular problems."
"344","Holmes and Rahe’s (1967) social readjustment ratings scale includes 43 examples of life changes and rates them according to how much stress they cause.
See the AO3 evaluation points for the SSRS for more evaluation of the link between life changes and stress."
"345","You get the idea. Kanner et al’s (1981) hassles and uplifts scale includes 117 examples of daily hassles, defined as “irritating, frustrating, distressing demands that to some degree characterise everyday transactions with the environment”.
See the AO3 evaluation points for the hassles and uplifts scale for more evaluation of the link between daily hassles and stress."
"346","The key theory that brings these 2 factors together is Karasek’s (1979) demand-control model. According to this model, high workload increases the likelihood of stress-related illness, but this risk is reduced when the employee has more control over their work.
Other workplace stressors may include annoying colleagues and bosses, concerns about getting fired or not promoted, and even just things in the general work environment like uncomfortable chairs."
"347","There are several ways of measuring stress. These include self-report methods (such as the social readjustment ratings scale and the hassles and uplifts scale) and physiological methods (such as skin conductance response).
Holmes and Rahe (1967) created the social readjustment ratings scale (SRRS) to quantify the stress associated with life changes.
To do this, they created a list of 43 life events and asked subjects to rate how stressful each was. Based on this data, each life event was given a life change unit (LCU) score. You can see the full list here."
"348","Kanner et al (1981) created the hassles and uplifts scale to quantify the stress associated with daily hassles.
The researchers got 100 participants to complete the hassles and uplifts scale by ticking which hassles and uplifts they had encountered over the previous month each month for 9 months. They found high scores for hassles were positively correlated with stress and health problems. They also found that high scores for uplifts were negatively correlated with stress and health problems – but only among women."
"349","There are several physiological methods for measuring stress. For example, cortisol levels in the blood and urine can be measured, and changes in blood pressure provide a reasonable proxy for changes in stress levels. But the syllabus mentions one physiological measure of stress in particular: Skin conductance response.
Water conducts electricity. And when a person is stressed, they sweat more. So, when a person is stressed, their skin conducts electricity more easily. This is how skin conductance response measures stress."
"350","There are many nomothetic ways of psychologically classifying people, and these differences between individuals and groups of individuals may mean differences in stress levels, stress responses, and stress-related illnesses.
The individual differences in stress mentioned on the syllabus are personality types (A, B, and C) and hardiness. The syllabus also mentions gender differences in coping with stress.
Friedman and Rosenman (1959) were interested in correlations between psychological personality types and cardiovascular disorders such as coronary artery disease. They identified certain patterns of behaviour, which they characterised into two personality types: Type A personality and Type B personality."
"351","Later research (Greer and Watson (1985)) identified a further personality type: The Type C personality.
Type C personalities are said to be more prone to stress than people who, for example, express their emotions freely and assert themselves. The researchers found that type C personalities are also associated with a higher risk of developing cancer. Some studies suggest this is due to immunosuppression."
"352","A general point with these links between personality types and stress-related illness is that the risks are relative: Type A personalities are more likely to get heart disease than Type B personalities, but this does not mean it is likely (in absolute terms) that type A personalities will get heart disease. (Illustrative example: Someone with a 2 in a million change of getting ill, say, is twice as likely to get ill as someone with a 1 in a million chance of getting ill – but 1 in a million is still a very low chance in absolute terms!)
In contrast, the non-hardy personality type is the opposite of this: They give up easily (low commitment), feel unable to cope with stressors (rather than seeing them as challenges), and have an external locus of control."
"353","Kobasa (1979) used the social readjustment ratings scale to identify 161 subjects who had undergone high levels of stress over the last 3 years. Of these 161 stressed individuals, 75 had suffered stress-related illness, whereas 86 had not. She then compared the personality traits of these two groups and found that the 86 subjects who did not get ill scored much higher for hardiness (i.e. demonstrated commitment, challenge, and control) than the 75 subjects who did get ill. This suggests that hardy personality types are more resistant to stress-related illnesses even when actual levels of stress are similar.
Gender differences in stress may include how men and women feel stress, as well as differences in how men and women cope and respond to stress."
"354","On average, the sympathomedullary fight or flight response differs between men and women. As discussed in the issues and debates topic, the phrase ‘fight or flight’ is an example of (beta) gender bias because it’s based solely on observations of male behavioural responses to stress. However, when Taylor et al (2000) observed the female behavioural responses to stress, they found women behaved more calmly and responded by protecting and caring for their offspring and seeking social support from friends and family. So, rather than ‘fight or flight’, the female behavioural response to stress can be characterised as ‘tend and befriend’. A potential mechanism for these differences in stress behaviours is differences in oxytocin levels."
"355","The biological approach to managing stress is drug therapy, such as the anti-anxiety medications benzodiazepines and beta blockers.
Benzodiazepines, such as Valium, increase the effects of a neurotransmitter called gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).
GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter which, if you remember from the biopsychology topic, means it decreases the likelihood that the neuron will fire. By increasing the effects of GABA, benzodiazepines reduce activity in the nervous system and counteract the effects of excitatory neurotransmitters such as serotonin. This reduced activity results in increased feelings of calm and relaxation, with reduced feelings of anxiety and stress.
Beta blockers reduce activity of the sympathetic nervous system by blocking beta-adrenergic receptors."
"356","As mentioned above, stressors cause the release of the hormones adrenaline and noradrenaline. When these hormones stimulate beta-adrenergic receptors in the heart and brain, it causes an increase in heart rate and blood flow. Beta blockers work by occupying these beta-adrenergic receptors – blocking them – so that adrenaline and noradrenaline can’t produce their usual effects. This reduces some of the physical symptoms of anxiety and stress, such as increased heart rate.
Meichenbaum (1985) describes stress inoculation therapy, which is a form of cognitive behavioural therapy."
"357","Social support – i.e. support from friends, family, colleagues, etc. – helps people deal with stress and lessen the effects of stressors. Biological mechanisms of aggression include neural mechanisms, hormones, and genetics.
Neural mechanisms (i.e. mechanisms of the nervous system) play a role in aggression. These include the limbic system of the brain and the neurotransmitter serotonin.
The limbic system is an area of the brain that plays a key role in emotional processing and is the main area of the brain associated with aggression.
In particular, the amygdala (an area of the limbic system) is associated with aggression."
"358","In particular, the amygdala (an area of the limbic system) is associated with aggression.
Hormones are chemicals produced in the body by glands (see the biopsychology page for more details). The main hormone the syllabus focuses on for aggression is testosterone.
Genetics are an important biological mechanism of aggression that may tie in with other biological factors. For example, a person may have genetics that predispose them to low serotonin activity, or genetics that encode for limbic system abnormalities."
"359","As always, twin studies are a useful way to determine the extent to which a behaviour or psychological condition is genetic. If concordance rates of aggression are higher among identical twins (who share 100% of their genes) than non-identical twins (who only share 50% of their genes), this shows that genetics play a role.
The higher concordance rates for aggression and criminality among identical twins than non-identical twins suggests there is a genetic component to aggression.
One gene in particular is associated with aggression, the MAOA gene."
"360","One gene in particular is associated with aggression, the MAOA gene.
The MAOA gene is responsible for producing monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), which is an enzyme that processes neurotransmitters such as serotonin. The low-activity form of the gene (MAOA-L or the “warrior gene”) results in lower levels of MAOA and is associated with aggression.
The link between the MAOA gene and aggression was discovered by Brunner et al (1993) in a study of a family in the Netherlands. 5 members of this family had a history of impulsive aggression and crime and the researchers discovered that all 5 had dysfunctional MAOA genes, which resulted in an MAOA deficiency."
"361","Ethology is the study of natural animal behaviour. Studying aggression in animals provides insights into aggression in humans and helps inform evolutionary explanations of human aggression."
"362","Lorenz (1966) argued that aggressive behaviour is an innate (i.e. biologically pre-programmed) response that has evolved to help species survive and pass on their genes. He argued that aggression is a biological need like eating or drinking. In the same way that hunger continuously builds up until an animal eats food, innate releasing mechanisms mean aggression continuously builds up until the animal behaves aggressively and satisfies that need."
"363","Patterns of aggressive behaviour within a species are often ritualistic. From an evolutionary perspective, it wouldn’t make sense for members of a species to try and actually kill each other every time they fight because then the species would go extinct. Instead, rituals enable members of a species to compete and establish dominance without actually harming each other. For example, a wolf who loses a fight exposes its neck to signal that it has lost. This position makes it easy for the winner to kill the loser but instead the fight ends there."
"364","Innate releasing mechanisms are biologically hard-wired mechanisms for aggression (e.g. brain structures or neural pathways for aggression). Environmental cues (e.g. the red belly of a rival stickleback) trigger the innate releasing mechanism. This releases a fixed action pattern of behaviour.
Aggressive behaviours within a species often follow set patterns known as fixed action patterns. These patterns are universal (i.e. the same) across the species and once they are initiated the animal will keep going until the behaviour is complete."
"365","Tinbergen (1952) demonstrates how fixed action patterns in sticklebacks are universal. When Tinbergen presented male sticklebacks with models of fish with red bellies (even when the model was not realistic looking), they all responded with the same fixed action pattern of fighting behaviour. The universal nature of this behaviour suggests the fixed action pattern is innate."
"366","Evolution is the process by which species adapt to their environment. Over many years, random mutations in genes that are advantageous (either in terms of survival or reproduction) become more widespread among the species. As well as physical characteristics, these genes may encode for certain behaviours such as aggression (e.g. fixed action patterns).
If a human is more likely to survive, then they are more likely to live long enough to reproduce and pass on their genes.
Social psychological explanations of aggression explain aggression as a result of social interactions with the environment. These explanations include the frustration-aggression hypothesis, social learning theory, and de-individuation."
"367","Dollard et al (1939) proposed the frustration-aggression hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, aggression is a response to frustration.
Frustration is defined as being prevented from achieving a goal. For example, if you’re trying to beat someone at tennis (your goal) but they keep beating you, this causes feelings of frustration. This frustration leads to aggression – either a feeling of aggression or actual aggressive behaviour. For example, if you get really frustrated, you might throw your racket at the other player."
"368","The likelihood of aggressive behaviour is proportional to the level of frustration; the more frustrated someone is, the more likely they are to act aggressively. For example, if a goal is really important to someone and something prevents them from achieving it, that person is more likely to get frustrated and behave aggressively than if it was a goal they didn’t care about.
Social learning theory (see the approaches page for more details) explains behaviour, such as aggression, as the result of observation and imitation of role models."
"369","A complete social learning explanation of aggression will also reference mediating processes: The cognitive factors in between observation and imitation that determine whether someone decides to imitate a behaviour or not. For example, if someone observes the role model being rewarded for aggressive behaviour, this provides motivation to imitate that behaviour and makes aggression more likely. However, if the role model is punished for aggression, this provides motivation not to behave aggressively and makes it less likely. The other mediating processes are attention, retention, and reproduction."
"370","Another key element of social learning theory that is relevant here is vicarious reinforcement. If a person sees the role model rewarded for behaving aggressively, they are more likely to imitate the aggressive behaviour.
De-individuation is when a person loses a sense of personal identity and personal responsibility. According to the de-individuation explanation, anonymity (e.g. by being part of a large crowd or wearing a disguise) makes a person more likely to behave aggressively."
"371","Festinger et al (1952) coined the phrase de-individuation to describe a phenomenon where people in crowds lose their sense of personal identity and instead identify with the morals and beliefs of a group. This feeling of anonymity in the crowd means people who might ordinarily be polite and civil may act aggressively and violently. A classic example of this would be a football fan who gets swept up in the crowd and behaves violently.
In addition to anonymity in a crowd, anonymity in other ways may cause de-individuation. For example, Dodd (1985) got 203 students to anonymously describe what they would do if nobody could identify them or hold them responsible for their actions. 36% of the responses involved some form of antisocial behaviour, with the most common answer being to rob a bank."
"372","Aggression in prisons is much higher than in ordinary contexts. There are two types of explanation for this increased aggression: Dispositional explanations and situational explanations.
Dispositional explanations say that aggression is higher in prisons because people who get sent to prison are naturally more aggressive – that they have a disposition towards aggression.
For whatever reason (biological factors, social factors, etc.), people from these subcultures have a disposition towards these behaviours – they act this way even when they aren’t in prison. And because these behaviours are more aggressive (at least within the thief and convict subcultures), these people are more likely to commit crimes and get arrested."
"373","The importation model says aggressive behaviours are imported into the prison from the outside. In contrast, situational explanations say that aggression is a response to the internal conditions of the prison itself.
In reality, both situational and dispositional explanations of institutional aggression are important. For example, Jiang and Fisher-Giorlando (2002) found that aggression towards prison staff was best explained by situational factors whereas aggression towards other inmates was best explained by the importation model. Rather than arguing that just one explanation being correct, you could take an interactionist approach.
Situational explanations say that something about the environment of prisons makes people behave more aggressively – that the situation causes aggression."
"374","Sykes calls these 5 deprivations the pains of imprisonment.
So, whereas dispositional explanations say prisoners are naturally more aggressive and import this aggression into the prison from the outside, the deprivation model blames the internal conditions of the prison for causing aggression.
In reality, both situational and dispositional explanations of institutional aggression are important. For example, Jiang and Fisher-Giorlando (2002) found that aggression towards prison staff was best explained by situational factors whereas aggression towards other inmates was best explained by the importation model. Rather than arguing that just one explanation being correct, you could take an interactionist approach."
"375","The media may cause people to act more aggressively. The syllabus focuses specifically on the influence of video games, which may cause desensitisation, disinhibition, and cognitive priming.
The natural reaction to aggression and violence is anxiety. But repeated exposure to such stimuli may reduce this emotional response – a person becomes desensitised to violence and aggression.
For example, a young child may be disturbed when they see somebody killed in a movie for the first time. But as an adult, the same sort of film does not provoke the same reaction because they’ve seen such depictions of violence many times and are now desensitised to it."
"376","In theory, desensitisation increases aggression. Natural emotional reactions (e.g. anxiety, stress, revulsion, etc.) that would normally prevent a person from being violent are no longer as strong as they once were and so the person is more likely to behave aggressively.
Inhibitions restrain us from behaving aggressively or inappropriately in real life. But within a video game, a person’s behaviour is disinhibited: They are free to act without consequence in ways they wouldn’t act in real life."
"377","For example, you wouldn’t randomly attack a person on the street. But when playing a video game there are no real consequences for doing so – the character can’t actually fight back, you can’t actually get arrested, and there is no social penalty. Things that inhibit aggressive behaviour are not present in video games.
In theory, disinhibition when playing video games can transfer to real life. Inhibitions that would normally prevent someone from behaving aggressively are worn down so that behaviours that were once considered morally unacceptable now seem more acceptable. This may make a person more likely to behave aggressively in real life."
"378","Cognitive priming is the idea that aggressive behaviours seen in the media are remembered and thus ‘prime’ a person to behave similarly when in similar situations. We absorb certain scripts for behaviour from media influences, and play out these scripts in similar situations.
For example, a man who watches a drama where a husband and wife argue over a comment made during dinner may remember and on some level learn this behaviour. If the man’s wife makes a negative comment during dinner one day, this memory primes him to argue with her like he saw in the drama."
"379","In theory, exposure to violence and aggression in video games and the media can prime people to behave more aggressively in real life. The top-down approach to offender profiling starts with pre-defined criminal profiles (based on experience) and works out which of these profiles the criminal fits into. In other words, the general profiles come first and the specific details come after. This in contrast to the bottom-up approach, which works the other way round.
Police in America tend to use the top-down approach, whereas police in Britain tend to use the bottom-up approach."
"380","First, data is assimilated. This just means data from the scene (e.g. photographs, fingerprints, interviews with witnesses, etc.) is gathered and examined. Next, this data is classified into one of two offender profiles.
For example, if a murder victim was stabbed but the knife is not found at the scene, that fits the organised profile. However, if the knife is left at the scene, that fits the disorganised profile. Similarly, if there are no fingerprints at the scene (e.g. because the offender brought gloves to wear), or if there is evidence that the victim was restrained, these features indicate planning and so fit the organised profile. In contrast, disorganised offenders do not plan their crimes and so would not think to bring e.g. gloves or something to restrain the victim."
"381","After the criminal is classified into one of these two offender profiles, the profiler will attempt to reconstruct the crime. This involves identifying the timeline of the crime – including both the criminal’s and victim’s behaviour.
Once this is complete, the profiler will generate a profile of the criminal. This involves filling in specific details about the criminal – e.g. physical and psychological characteristics – beyond those described in the organised or disorganised profiles. This narrows down the range of suspects."
"382","Whereas the top-down approach starts with possible profiles and fits the criminal to one of them, the bottom-up approach starts with the criminal’s characteristics and develops the profile based on that. In other words, the specific details of the crime come first and the general profile comes second.
Police in Britain tend to use the bottom-up approach, whereas Police in America tend to use the top-down approach.
Investigative psychology is the use of scientific psychology and psychological theory to solve crimes and identify criminals."
"383","A key concept within investigative psychology, described in Canter (1994), is interpersonal coherence. This means that the way a criminal behaves when they are committing a crime will be consistent with how they behave in everyday life. For example, a killer who commits aggressive murders is likely to be an aggressive person in general. So, if there is evidence of an aggressive murder, the profile of the suspect will include an aggressive personality."
"384","Statistical analysis (e.g. multidimensional scaling or smallest space analysis) is used in investigative psychology to identify common themes and patterns of behaviour across several crime scenes. For example, details about the type of victim, what specific acts are committed, and how evidence is disposed of can be used to identify crimes committed by the same person. Because of interpersonal coherence, this data may also provide details about the criminal and narrow down the range of possible suspects. Statistical data can also be used to provide information about the offender’s location through geographical profiling.
Geographical profiling is the use of statistical analysis to make inferences about the offender’s geographical location."
"385","The circle hypothesis says that serial offenders carry out their crimes within a geographical circle. The circle hypothesis also predicts that the offender’s home will be within this circle.
Canter and Larkin (1993) tested the circle hypothesis by studying the locations of sexual assaults committed by 45 British serial offenders. They found that 39 of the 45 offenders (87%) lived within the circle predicted by the circle hypothesis, suggesting it is valid."
"386","19th Century criminologist Cesare Lombroso proposed that criminals are biologically different from modern humans. He argued that criminals have more in common with our evolutionary ancestors than normal humans do.
An atavism is when an ancestral genetic trait that has disappeared reappears – like a human that grows a vestigial tail. Hence, Lombroso’s theory is called atavistic form: The idea is that criminality represents the behaviours of earlier, more savage, pre-human species – like Neanderthals or homo habilis.
Further, Lombroso argued, different types of criminal have typical facial features. For example, he argued that murderers typically have curly hair and bloodshot eyes, whereas sex offenders have swollen and fleshy lips."
"387","In support of this theory, Lombroso collected measurements of the facial features of thousands of Italian criminals. However, atavistic form is described as ‘an historical approach’ on the syllabus because few scientists now take it seriously.
Several types of evidence support the existence of a genetic explanation of criminal behaviour, such as twin studies and gene association studies.
These studies show the concordance rates for criminal behaviour are higher among identical twins (who share 100% of their genes) than non-identical twins (who only share 50% of their genes). This supports a role for genetics in explaining criminal behaviour."
"388","These results suggest that having a biological parent who is a criminal is a better predictor of whether the child will go on to be a criminal than if the adoptive parents are criminal. This further supports a role for genetics in explaining criminal behaviour.
Although there is no single ‘criminal gene’, several genes have been linked with criminal behaviour.
For example, the MAOA-L gene is linked with aggressive behaviour (see the aggression page for more details), which is in turn linked with criminal behaviour. For example, Brunner et al (1993) studied a family with a history of aggressive and criminal behaviour, and found that all the male members had the MAOA-L gene. This is an example of a gene that could (partly) explain criminal behaviour."
"389","The MAOA-L gene affects how neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, are processed. The fact that this gene is associated with criminality thus also supports a neural explanation of criminal behaviour.
Neural factors such as brain structure and neurotransmitters affect behaviour, which suggests neural explanations of criminal behaviour.
For example, Raine et al (1997) compared brain scans conducted on 41 convicted murderers and with brain scans conducted on 41 control participants. The researchers observed that the murderers had reduced activity in the prefrontal cortex, the superior parietal gyrus, left angular gyrus, and the corpus callosum compared to the control group."
"390","Neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and dopamine, may also explain criminal behaviour. For example, Brunner et al (1993) described above demonstrates a link between genes responsible for processing neurotransmitters and violent behaviour. These effects on neurotransmitters may be why these genes increase violent behaviour, suggesting a link between abnormal neurotransmitter activity and criminality.
Eysenck’s theory of personality is a general theory of personality. According to Eysenck, a person’s biology (i.e. their genes) predispose them towards certain personality traits.
These traits can be measured by completing a questionnaire called the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire."
"391","Cognitive explanations of criminal behaviour focus on the cognitions (e.g. thoughts and beliefs) of offenders. These include inadequate development of moral reasoning and cognitive distortions such as hostile attribution bias and minimalisation.
According to Kohlberg, the majority of people advance to the conventional morality stage of moral reasoning (and some people advance beyond that to post-conventional morality e.g. by doing philosophy).
But some people do not progress past the childlike pre-conventional morality stage. According to Kohlberg, this makes a person more likely to commit a crime."
"392","Cognitive distortions are consistent deviations from rational thought that cause people to perceive things inaccurately. Examples of cognitive distortions that may explain criminal behaviour include hostile attribution bias and minimalisation.
If someone has a hostile attribution bias, they will tend to misinterpret people’s actions as in some way hostile or negative.
For example, someone with a hostile attribution bias may interpret an innocent look from another person as aggressive, which may cause the person with hostile attribution bias to respond aggressively or violently.
Minimalisation is a cognitive distortion where a person downplays how bad their criminal behaviour really is. This may involve justifications that reduce the offender’s sense of guilt."
"393","For example, a thief may tell himself that his victim was rich and he’s poor so it’s fair to steal from them. Or a violent offender may tell herself that an assault wasn’t that bad.
Sutherland (1939) describes differential association theory: a learning approach that explains criminal behaviour as learned from environmental influences."
"394","According to differential association theory, criminal behaviour is learned by associating with people who commit crimes. A person is more likely to engage in criminal activity the more of these differential associations with criminals a person has, the closer the relationships to these criminals are (e.g. parents and siblings), and the longer the duration of time spent interacting with them is. Sutherland argued these factors – frequency, duration, intensity, etc. of differential associations – can be used to mathematically predict how likely a person is to be a criminal."
"395","Through associations with criminals, a person learns both specific methods of crime (e.g. how to source and supply drugs or how to break into houses without setting off alarms) as well as certain attitudes towards crime (e.g. that being a successful thief drug dealer is worthy of respect and that police are the bad guys). Again, the more exposure to these attitudes a person encounters, the more likely they are to engage in criminal behaviour themself.
Psychodynamic explanations of criminal behaviour explain crime as the result of unconscious conflicts with different parts of the mind. Freud’s psychoanalytic theory can be applied to criminal behaviour, as can Bowlby’s maternal deprivation hypothesis."
"396","According to Freud’s psychoanalytic theory, the superego is a person’s conscience – the part of personality responsible for morality. The superego tries to prevent the person from doing bad things but if a person does something wrong then the superego punishes the ego through guilt.
According to Freud’s psychoanalytic theory, the ego uses defence mechanisms to mediate between the id and the superego.
Englander (2007) argues that the displacement defence mechanism may explain violent behaviour. For example, a person may be angry about something that happened at work and this anger may manifest as getting into a fight in a pub later that day."
"397","Bowlby’s maternal deprivation hypothesis (see the attachment page for more details) may also provide a psychodynamic explanation of criminal behaviour.
These figures appear to show a strong correlation between maternal deprivation and criminal behaviour.
The psychodynamic explanation of this link is something like: Maternal deprivation causes difficulties in forming attachments in later life as well as a negative view of the world. This manifests in emotional problems such as aggression and depression, which increase the likelihood of criminal behaviour.
The syllabus mentions several methods of dealing with criminal behaviour and their aims. These include custodial sentencing (prison), behaviour modification, anger management, and restorative justice."
"398","Custodial sentencing means sentencing an offender to spend time in prison.
Recidivism means reoffending."
"399","The graph above shows that recidivism is negatively correlated with the length of custodial sentence. In other words, the longer the custodial sentence, the less likely an offender is to reoffend. Offenders given custodial sentences longer than 10 years are significantly less likely to reoffend (~10%) than offenders given custodial sentences of 6 months or less (~60%).
Behaviour modification uses the behaviourist principles of operant conditioning – positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, and punishment – to encourage good behaviour and discourage criminal behaviour while in prison."
"400","An example of a behaviour modification techniques is the use of token economies. In a prison token economy, offenders earn tokens for good behaviour (e.g. following the rules, participating in rehabilitation programs, etc.) and these tokens can be used to buy things (e.g. food and cigarettes). This positively reinforces good behaviour. Token economies may also work by negatively reinforcing bad behaviour. For example, prison guards may take tokens away for bad behaviour.
Token economies were originally developed to treat mental illness (see the schizophrenia page for more details) but the principles were later adapted to the prison context."
"401","Anger management therapies are based on the principle of the cognitive approach that cognitions (i.e. thoughts and beliefs) cause emotions, such as anger. It is often used for offenders whose crimes are the result of uncontrolled anger (e.g. assault).
Restorative justice programs are about getting the offender to recognise the consequences of their actions and make amends to their victim(s).
Both the offender and the victim must consent to a restorative justice program. The offender must acknowledge responsibility for their crime and be willing to voluntarily take steps to repair the damage they have caused. The victim must also be willing to take part in the program, and it should not cause them further trauma."
"402","In the case of something like vandalism, restorative justice might require the vandal to spend time fixing the property they damaged. With something like assault, it’s not like the offender can un-punch the victim, so restorative justice may involve communication between the offender and victim – for example, via in-person meeting or correspondence by letter – where the victim can express how they were affected and the offender can express their remorse and apologise. These symptoms differ depending on whether the addiction is to a substance (e.g. nicotine) or behaviour (e.g. gambling)."
"403","For example, a person with alcohol addiction may experience withdrawal symptoms upon stopping drinking (physical dependence). But even after these withdrawal symptoms have passed and the person is no longer physically dependent on alcohol, they may have urges to drink alcohol that persist for much longer (psychological dependence).
Tolerance is when a person’s response to a drug reduces such that they need higher and higher doses to achieve the same effect."
"404","Tolerance occurs because the body adjusts to use of the drug in order to maintain homeostasis (feeling and functioning normally). For example, drinking alcohol disrupts the brain’s normal functioning and so the brain reacts to bring things back to normal and achieve homeostasis. This creates a new ‘normal’ and so the person then has to drink more next time in order to get the same buzz as before.
Tolerance to one drug often creates increased tolerance to other drugs. For example, smoking cigarettes (nicotine) increases tolerance to caffeine because caffeine and nicotine have similar effects in the body. This is known as cross-tolerance."
"405","Withdrawal syndrome is when a person develops unpleasant symptoms upon stopping or reducing drug use. These may include pain, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and shaking.
Withdrawal symptoms are often the opposite of the ones created by the drug. For example, a person addicted to painkillers may experience severe pain when they stop using the painkillers. The unpleasantness of withdrawal symptoms creates a motivation to continue using the drug: Taking the drug reduces withdrawal symptoms."
"406","The extent of withdrawal syndrome depends on which drug the person is addicted to (e.g. heroin withdrawal is typically more severe then nicotine), how much they use (typically, the greater quantity of drugs a person uses, the worse the withdrawal), and how frequently they use it (e.g. regular use at the same time of day will typically cause worse withdrawal than sporadic use).
However, it’s impossible for addiction to be 100% genetic. A person with a genetic predisposition towards heroin addiction, for example, can’t become addicted to heroin if they never encounter the drug in the first place. So, genetic vulnerability must interact with environment to cause addiction.
Stress is a risk factor for addiction – both in the short term and historically."
"407","Stress is a risk factor for addiction – both in the short term and historically.
In the short term, a person may turn to addictive substances as a way of coping with stress. For example, a person may turn to alcohol after a stressful day at work. Over time, this may become a regular habit and eventually result in an addiction to alcohol.
However, mediating factors may reduce the risk of addiction in response to stress. For example, if a person is under a high amount of stress but has a strong support network, this may improve their ability to cope with the stress and reduce the risk of addiction."
"408","Further, historical stress – particularly during childhood – is also a risk factor for addiction. For example, Andersen and Teicher (2009) describe how stress during childhood and adolescence (a ‘sensitive period’) affects brain development, making a person more vulnerable to addiction in adulthood. Another example is Epstein et al (1998), who found that sexual abuse in childhood meant women were twice as likely to develop alcohol addiction as adults.
Certain personality traits appear to be risk factors for developing addiction – although whether there is such a thing as an ‘addictive personality’ is disputed by many psychologists."
"409","Eysenck (1997) argues that certain personality types – such as people high in neuroticism (a tendency towards negative feelings) and psychoticism (a tendency towards aggression and impulsivity) – are more prone to addiction. According to this theory, the needs of these personality types make them more prone to addiction. For example, drugs may alleviate the negative feelings of a neurotic personality type, making them more likely to get addicted.
Family influence is another risk factor for addiction. It can be explained in several ways."
"410","Family influence is another risk factor for addiction. It can be explained in several ways.
According to social learning theory, people learn and imitate behaviours of role models they identify with. Assuming this theory is correct, it would go a long way to explaining addiction. For example, a child may identify with their cigarette-smoking father (role model) and observe the reward (pleasure/stress relief) he gets from smoking. This provides vicarious reinforcement of cigarette-smoking behaviour, which makes the child more likely to try cigarettes and become addicted."
"411","Another explanation of family influence on addiction is perceived parental approval. If a child perceives that their parents have a positive (or at least neutral) attitude towards a drug, this makes them more likely to try and become addicted to that drug. For example, Livingston et al (2010) found that children whose parents allowed them to drink alcohol in their final year of high school were more likely to drink heavily the next year at college.
Like family, peer influence may also increase the likelihood that a person develops an addiction."
"412","Like family, peer influence may also increase the likelihood that a person develops an addiction.
For example, if a person’s friendship group all starts smoking cigarettes, it makes that person more likely to try smoking and become addicted to cigarettes. Their friends may offer them cigarettes, or the person may feel left out if all their friends are smoking and they’re not.
Again, social learning theory can be applied here: If someone identifies with their friend, sees them smoke cigarettes and be rewarded for that behaviour (e.g. others think it’s cool), this provides vicarious reinforcement of that behaviour, making them more likely to imitate it."
"413","Nicotine is a highly addictive substance found in cigarettes. The syllabus lists two explanations of nicotine addiction: Neurochemistry (the dopamine desensitisation hypothesis) and learning theory explanations.
This stimulation of the dopamine system is known as the common reward pathway.
Further neurochemical explanation of nicotine addiction can be found in the nicotine regulation model. According to this model, prolonged periods without nicotine causes nAChRs receptors to become resensitised to nicotine (upregulation). This state of having many nAChRs receptors that are available but not stimulated causes withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety. Smoking alleviates these withdrawal symptoms and reinforces the behaviour."
"414","The nicotine regulation model explains why smokers find the first cigarette of the day to be the most satisfying: During sleep, nAChRs receptors are upregulated and become more sensitive, resulting in a greater dopamine release when smoking resumes.
Learning theory explains nicotine addiction as learned behaviour in response to environmental stimuli.
The pleasant sensations of smoking can also become associated with cues in the environment via classical conditioning. For example, if a person regularly smokes cigarettes when they’re in a pub, then they may condition themself to associate pubs with smoking. Once this association is learned, going to the pub may trigger an urge to smoke cigarettes. This is known as cue reactivity."
"415","Learning theory explanations of nicotine addiction may also include social learning, such as the peer pressure example described above.
Addiction is typically associated with substances (such as nicotine) that have biological effects in the body. However, people can also get addicted to certain behaviours, such as gambling. Because these behaviours don’t directly cause biological effects in the same way as addictive substances, explanations of gambling addiction tend to be more psychological than biological. The syllabus lists two such examples: Learning theory and cognitive explanations.
Learning theory explains gambling addiction as learned behaviour. This primarily occurs through operant conditioning."
"416","The positive reinforcement of gambling is obvious: Winning money. Other factors, such as the lights and sounds of the machines, the social aspect of a casino/betting shop, and the excitement and anticipation of a gamble provide further positive reinforcement. This makes the person more likely to repeat the behaviour.
But gamblers typically lose more money than they win. These losses should serve as negative reinforcement that makes the person less likely to repeat the behaviour. So why do people get addicted to gambling?"
"417","Skinner found that animals rewarded with continuous reinforcement schedules quickly stopped the target behaviour as soon as the rewards stopped. In other words, they soon unlearned the behaviour they had previously been conditioned to learn. However, when the reward schedule was partial and unpredictable, the animals continued the target behaviour for much longer after the rewards stopped.
The same principle applies to gambling addiction. The unpredictability of wins means gambling behaviour is maintained even after successive losses. The gambler thinks “maybe next time I will get a big win”."
"418","Variable ratios are typically the most addictive (and most profitable). Again, when the rewards are unpredictable, the gambler thinks “maybe next time”. These thoughts and the gambling behaviour are reinforced with occasional wins, leading to addiction.
According to cognitive explanations, such irrational thought processes cause and sustain gambling addiction.
There are many different treatments to help reduce addiction, including drug therapy, behavioural approaches, cognitive behavioural therapy, and application of theories such as planned behaviour and Prochaska’s six-stage model. The most effective approach to reducing addiction will depend on what the patient is addicted to and what stage of recovery they’re at."
"419","Commonly-used drug therapies for nicotine addiction include nicotine patches, nicotine gum, and nicotine inhalers. These work as agonists by binding to the same receptors (nAChRs) and causing similar effects (e.g. dopamine release). This reduces the withdrawal symptoms when an addict stops smoking.
Although gambling addiction is not an addiction to a biological substance, drug therapy can still be effective. Gambling activates similar dopamine-related reward pathways to heroin and other drugs, so antagonists such as naltrexone may reduce the desire to gamble. However, it is not officially approved for this use."
"420","Behavioural interventions use behaviourist principles to treat addiction. Aversion therapy and covert sensitisation use classical conditioning to create negative associations with the addictive substance or behaviour.
Aversion therapy uses classical conditioning to replace the positive associations of an addictive substance with negative associations.
The emetic drug disulfiram (described above) works on this principle: When combined with alcohol, it makes the patient feel very unwell. So, where alcohol would normally cause pleasant sensations, it now creates unpleasant ones. Over time and continued use, the patient learns to associate alcohol with unpleasant sensations even when they no longer take disulfiram."
"421","In addition to emetics (drugs that induce sickness), there are numerous other ways to create negative associations with an addictive substance. For example, researchers have used electric shocks in attempt to treat gambling addiction. And a commonly-used aversion therapy technique for nicotine addiction was to get subjects to rapidly smoke cigarettes one after another, which causes feelings of sickness. The idea with all these methods is to create negative associations with the addictive substance, which should reduce addiction.
Covert sensitisation also operates on the behaviourist principle of classical conditioning but uses imagination rather than real-life unpleasant stimuli."
"422","For example, to treat nicotine addiction, a therapist may get the patient to imagine feeling sick while smoking cigarettes. In theory, the stronger and more realistic the mental image is, the more successful the therapy is. So, the therapist may use graphic and disgusting imagery to treat the addiction (e.g. getting the patient to imagine smoking cigarettes covered in faeces). At the end of the session the therapist may get the patient to imagine feelings of happiness at not having to smoke cigarettes and so, in addition to negative associations with smoking cigarettes, the patient will also develop positive associations with not smoking cigarettes."
"423","As with aversion therapy, the goal of covert sensitisation is to turn the unconditioned positive stimulus of the addictive substance/behaviour into a conditioned negative stimulus. This reduces the addiction.
Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) involves identifying and challenging the thought processes of addiction. This can be broken down into a cognitive component (functional analysis) and a behavioural component (skills training).
With functional analysis, the CBT therapist may get the patient to describe what they think before, during, and after indulging their addiction. The therapist will then help the patient challenge any irrational and maladaptive thought processes during this sequence."
"424","For example, in the case of gambling addiction, the patient may tell themself “I’ll stop when I win back what I’ve lost”. The therapist could then get the patient to reflect on and challenge such thoughts and how they make the situation worse.
Psychologists have developed theories of behaviour change, such as planned behaviour and Prochaska’s six-stage model, that can be applied to addicts to reduce addiction. The idea is that tailoring treatments for each person according to these models will increase the likelihood of behavioural change and reduce their addiction.
The theory of planned behaviour predicts that the greater the level of intention, the more likely that person is to give up their addiction."
"425","So, in order to improve the likelihood of behavioural change, interventions based on this model should seek to increase the addict’s intention to quit. For example, if a recovering drug addict still associates with other drug addicts, the subjective norms of his peer group will reduce his intention to quit. Tackling this negative peer influence and providing social support from people who do not use drugs will increase his intention to quit, making recovery more likely.
Behavioural change does not happen instantly. Instead, Prochaska and DiClemente (1983) outline a six-stage model that describes the various steps that occur between addiction and rehabilitation. The idea is that tailoring intervention to each stage of this model increases the likelihood of behavioural change."
"426","A recovering addict will not necessarily go through these steps in a linear fashion. For example, many people relapse after the maintenance phase and return to e.g. the contemplation or preparation stages. The six-stage model acknowledges relapse as part of the process of behavioural change rather than a failure."
